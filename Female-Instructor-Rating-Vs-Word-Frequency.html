Very in depth lectures with good examples. Tough grader, but enough extra credit that you can make up for it.", "Be prepared to be stressed, feel defeated, and frustrated. She is a tough grader and not always good at clarifying, and can seem condescending towards her students when they don't perform to her VERY high standards. Overall though, Dr. Harris is a good teacher. YOU WILL LEARN A LOT. And she spends a lot of time giving in depth feed back on HW.", "She is a nit picky grader and will question the smallest details of your work. She wants you to succeed, but at the cost of your grade.", "She uses powerpoints that have inaccurate material to teach. Her lectures consist of her reading her powerpoints word for word and getting other students to answer in class questions that she does not seem to know the answer to.", "Dr. Harris was thorough in and extremely helpful giving step by step instructions to produce a quality material in a manufacturing environment Thank you Dr. Harris for you support.", "Worst choice for a studio professor.  She is subjective in grading, condescending, and pompous.  Plan to stay the full 3 hours EVERY time, even if it's just to hear her complain about her opinion of class presentations (I don't like the border, etc).  I got an A but I wish I had a better professor.", "It's encouraging to take a class in which the professor is so passionate about the topic. Professor Arriaga does research in HCI so she lives and breathes the material from this class. She knows what she's talking about and truly cares about students learning. She lays out her expectations and assignments and makes the material easy to understand.", "She has a heavy curve and gives extra credit. Make sure you write down the answers to the clicker questions; studying them is a good way to prepare for exams. Her class is boring, but she explains things well. Clicker questions are part of the grade. She explicitly states she doesn't test on anything she doesn't talk about in lecture.", "Nice professor with genuine interest in the class.  Easy to learn from.", "Provides insight from research interest.", "What a boring class.... I bombed the first 2 tests, 60 and 47. Got a 71 on the final (not cumulative). Those are each weighted 20%. Lab is 30% (has used same labs for like 10+ yrs) and attendance/clicker is 10%. Extra credit assignment add 4 points to your overall grade. My grade ended up being 79, which was a \"B.\" An \"A\" ended up being an 84.", "I took diff eq through the distance math program. Her exams for distance students were difficult, but she's great at explaining concepts and she puts in extra hours to make sure you understand the material.", "She explains things clearly. She also moves at a very reasonable pace and reviews concepts in class instead of rushing through the material like the other profs. She's willing to answer all of your questions and she's super nice. She does make a few mistakes on the board though but she'll give out candy for every 15 mistakes she makes!", "I had a lot of problems with this class, thankfully Amalia did her best to make my time easier. Gives very good feedback and is very responsive and helpful whenever you have concerns. She is very clear about the topics you should know for each exam and is more than willing to give a bit of a curve for the sake of fairness.", "By far the best math teacher I have had at Tech. She explains things very clearly and moves at a pace so that you don't feel like the class is a week ahead of what you are understanding. The lectures are very interactive and she strives to get students involved during lecture. As long as you do the homework and go to lecture, the tests are doable.", "I absolutely loved this class. Her lecture style is extremely clear, and she breaks down difficult math concepts into step-by-step processes that make the material very easy to remember. She's also just very nice and sociable to be around. I hope to take her for my diff eqs class next semester cause my first experience was so great.", "She's great! explains things really well and is very reasonable", "Her lectures are great, her tests and quizzes are topical, she's funny, and she makes an effort to get to know the students.", "Tests are fairly straightforward, shouldn't have to study too much; weekly quizzes which help a lot; lectures are easy to follow; Amalia is easy to reach outside of class and gives good feedback; class curved at the end.", "Math at Tech is HAAARD, but Amalia is both fair, supportive, humorous funny. The way she approaches lectures is very effective: she lays out the basic maths concept, explains it again in layman's words, then does a few examples. Practice your homework until you understand it WELL or you'll suffer. She curves, so don't freak out. Also: OFFICE HOURS.", "Easy class to get an A in. Her Powerpoints are sometimes useful. Majority of the time she wasn't sure about how to answer questions, so she would just ask the TAs. If you do the HW assignments and attend recitations, you should do well, but do not rely on the professor because she doesn't have much Python knowledge.", "Watson-Phillips was a highschool AP CS teacher that went and got a PhD in CS later. However, she still teaches her class like a highschool environment, but most real teaching (at least that sticks with anyone in the class) is done by TA's. She's fine, but doesn't inspire confidence in her knowledge of course material and made lectures feel a waste.", "she is the worst professor I've had at Tech. apparently everybody complained about her the first time she taught the class in Spring 2019 and then ga tech disregarded all the CIOS feedback and made her head of the class...? zell miller should not even pay for this unhelpful, boring class", "Terrible at explaining concepts, even though lectures are mandatory.", "She is just as bad as everyone says, but the TAs normally keep you afloat. The homeworks aren't bad if you start them when they come out. You do have to stay on top of things, and the exams are pretty wack.", "I learned nothing from her lectures. She was not helpful, was often rude or brief with students, and constantly used circular reasoning. TAs were great and recitation was helpful. A few times, the TAs would teach lecture, and they would get an applause at the end. Hw was frequent and participation quizzes counted everyday.", "The worst professor I have ever had. Is straight up incapable of teaching. Exams are unnecessarily hard and misleading. The only people that get A's in this class are people that have already had plenty of Java experience.", "Teaches a class in Python, but does not know Python. TA's taught most of the class. I loved the material but she almost ruined it for me. It's not that the material is all that difficult, but her tests are challenging and was very rude and unaccommodating when I had a concussion. Made a short multiple choice final and last test that were very hard", "Lectures cover 70-80% of exam material but you have to take very detailed notes and ask questions. She posts old exams which are extremely useful for practice. The lectures become less detailed once JavaFX is covered. Better than mcDaniel who steals from Suzy and doesn't understand half the code stolen. Best advice is do checkpoints and old tests.", "Tests are fair, recitation is more helpful. The lecture covers 20-30% what you need to know on the exam. Easily to get lost in class. I'd say that she is not that bad if you try to listen but she is realllly boring so... Honestly don't give up if you have her, just suck it up and push thru. By having her you will really know what is self-teaching.", "I self-taught bc I did not want to fail. The lecture is not useful for people who have learned OOP and not useful for people(me) who do not know OOP. I only go bc she takes attendance. The class is so dry that it is just torture of 50 mins. I wake up in the morning and I'm never excited about my day because of WP. If you have her GL, dont cry.", "Worst professor I've had at Tech. She doesn't know how to lecture and does not teach concepts that end up being on the homework and tests.", "Don't ever expect her to help you out if you have policy issues related to the course.", "Horrible professor; refused to help student; zero tolerance at any grading; forget to sign honor code is the best way make you from A to a C; absent without notifying the student and TA end up teaching; TA teaches better than she does; her background is all java but she teaches python; mumbling through slide during all lecture. Never take her!!!!!", "You really get nothing from lecture, she goes through everything swiftly, and never explains anything throughly. I am really disappointed, as i believed that this course would be actually helpful, but for me she ruined it", "Teaches Python, but she doesn't know Python. Also, she mumbles through the entire lecture.", "She's alright, I never bought the textbook and stayed afloat with only lecture, but lots of pop quizzes which count for attendance.", "She's a new professor, and the year started off pretty badly, but things got better later on. It's hard to follow along and take notes in the lecture, but the tests aren't too bad. Just be sure to go to recitation. She's not a 5 star professor, but not really a 1 star either.", "I'm surprised there aren't more ratings for her on here. She's hands down the best professor I've had! She's super engaging, she uses core concepts and takes several checkpoints through the lecture to make sure everyone's on board, and she's very encouraging. Attendance is optional but counts toward your grade. Final can replace lowest test grade.", "Dr Leavey is very weird. She occasionally has a semi-twisted sense of humor that she shares, but then she audibly reacts negatively to dark humor from guest lecturers. She seems to be weirdly rude to them, and 3/4 of the guests are incredibly boring. You have to go to class, but everybody sleeps during it.", "COS2000 is a joke of a class, and it's impossible to not get an A. I just wanted to comment on Dr. Leavey herself. She was incredibly rude to all of the guest lecturers the entire semester. It was apparent to everyone in the 200 person lecture that she managed to hate the class more than everyone in there. And that says a lot.", "Leavey did not answer questions clearly and offended a lot of people with her politics during her lectures and acted disinterested/miffed in office hours. Her class was harder than it needed to be. I was stuck having to take her for 3 classes. I recommend staying away from the Biology Dept at GT completely. They don't teach and your grades suffer.", "In 1510 she was the harder half of the class because she assumed everyone did the reading in advance while no one did really, and as a result there was a gap between what she was teaching and what we knew.", "Flipped classroom. Taught with Professor Spencer. Before class, readings and videos online and graded questions. In class, graded application questions you were expected to know how to do. 5% extra credit built into course. It's hard to know what you have in the class until the very end. One group video project at the end. Tests are fair.", "No textbook. Used \"Learning Catalytics\" question/quiz site as the textbook and was pretty much the only thing used to study for the exams. If you missed a day of class, that would be docked from your participation grade. Also, this class was terribly boring and Dr. Leavey doesn't seem to know much about the subject she's teaching.", "the flipped classroom thing is incredibly annoying, the website is choppy and it's hard to determine what is extra information and what's not, they made bio 1510 harder than it needed to be, also leavey isn't the best at explaining simple topics", "I really don't think this woman should be working in academia. She doesn't lecture during class, but has students complete team activities which aren't very helpful for the tests. I found it more helpful to ask the TA questions since she seemed quite impatient during the one time I did attend her office hours.", "Dr. Leavey is an AMAZING professor! She is enthusiastic and has a fun personality, which make the lectures so much more interesting. There's a lot of work (as a a result of the subject matter) so it's imperative to study. She is great at engaging the class and wants everyone to do well.  If you can take a class with her, I highly recommend it!", "Leavey is a good professor. Tests are hard, and so is the final. PRS taken, and MasteringBio homework. There is a group project, but isn't too bad if you actually put in work. Recommend", "Go to class just for the PRS. You'll be learning from the textbook and MasteringBio, both of which suck. You'll have to study a lot. The tests are horrible and the final is all case studies. God bless you if you also get Christine Spencer. That woman is horrible. Good luck, brave soul.", "Unorganized, no communication it seems between her and TAs. 3 exams no drop, no extra credit offered and says she doesnt believe in curves. Unwilling to meet or answer questions at times. Exams are extremely difficult and lecture is too vague. Nothing prepares you for the exams.", "She is a horrible teacher. The way that the test are written doesn't correlate to the lectures given in class . The point distribution on the test is ridiculous (15 questions and written response the written response is 22 point! out if the 35 pt test. The way that she grade as well is completely ridiculous if your response does not match you fail.", "She's great. She doesn't lecture too much, but when she does she does a fantastic job. She provides interesting videos and gives us fun group exercises. We were given everything we could need to succeed in the class. As long as you show up to class and do the online assignments, an A is attainable. I definitely recommend taking Dr. Angra.", "100% would take again. Very understanding and kind towards students. Always answered questions during lecture clearly and concisely. I looked forward to her lectures. Tests/quizzes/homeworks were always very fair and easy to pass with a bit of effort. Fantastic professor.", "Best math professor I have ever had. Yao Yao truly wants her students to succeed and is very accessible during office hours and via Piazza (usually responds within 2 hours). Grading scheme, quizzes, tests, and final is very fair along with a 2% extra credit boost to the final grade. Overall, a very good course and easy A with considerable effort.", "Dr. Yao is a great professor: available during office hours/after class, good at explaining things, great sense of humor, appreciates cat memes. Makes a lot of mistakes whilst teaching, but is really nice about it if you call her out. Tests are really fair and so is the final (just do her practice problems and read your notes)", "Dr. Yao is the best professor I have ever had! The lectures were all phenomenal and I actually learned in them. There were short weekly sets of online HW. The three grading schemes were very generous because they took into account the varying strengths of your quizzes, midterms, and final. Attendance at recitation2% added to our final total grade", "Lectures are boring which seems to be true of any math at Tech. HW is online with unlimited attempts, which is easy but also very helpful to learn the material. She cracks jokes every so often in lecture and seems to really care about her students. 2 tests and 5 quizzes are quite fair. Overall, one of the better Tech math profs. Would recommend.", "Dr. Yao is my favorite math professor I've had at Tech so far. Lectures are somewhat boring , as math lectures tend to be, and they can be information dense at times - but she does her best to crack jokes, show real-world applications, and overall make lecture enjoyable. Very little homework, tests and quizzes were very fair. Highly recommend.", "Best math prof I've had at Tech. Lectures are dull (like every math class at Tech) but straightforward and easy to follow. She clearly explains topics as well as how they relate to the rest of the course. Grade based on 4 easy quizzes, 2 tests and the final. Optional HW is a good study resource. Very kind prof and made jokes every now and then.", "Professor Yao was a good professor! You can really tell she is passionate about what she is teaching, and makes little jokes every once in a while.", "Professor Yao is incredibly kind. Her lectures are fairly boring but I find that to be the case with most math professors. You can at least tell she's passionate about the material which is nice. Homework is optional which is a huge plus. There are four easy quizzes, two difficult midterms (which were curved) and a fair final.", "My favorite math prof of all time . She makes concepts SUPER clear. I used to look forward to lecture all the time. Her way of explaining is unique and she helps you understand the intuition behind obscure theorems. One of the nicest people I know. I used to look forward to lecture every day. See the section about UW madison on RMP for more info.", "Dr. Yao was awesome!! She was super responsive to the needs of the class, curved the class to meet the historical average, gave clear lectures, and was honest about what we needed to know and what it would take to succeed in the class. She's also the nicest person on Earth and has her fair share of memes.", "Nasty course, bur Dr. Paty made it survivable, but you have got to be prepared to do the work, otherwise you will get chewed up if you fall behind. She is willing to help students, but there has to be a reason, she is not here to give you an A unless you put in the work.", "I was in Physics of Planets Fall 2011. Dr. Paty's presentations were very clear and included many examples from current exploration and research. She is still finding the right difficulty level for homework: the first assignment was pretty brutal, but the rest were very reasonable. Tests were through, but fair and able to be completed within time.", "Easy to understand and very helpful. Gives easy homework assignments, but they really help to clarify concepts for the exams.", "The worst professor EVER. Course: intro to engr, BME focus. Never teaches anything. Not an exaggeration. Brings in other people to teach and dips class. And these other people don't even teach relevant material. Grades based on what is never taught. Email her, she treats you like an idiot. Students have been to more classes than her.", "I can confirm many of the other comments here, at least as I experienced class with Prof Snider. I found her condescending as well. The worst part was her unwillingness to correct grading errors when she was in fact incorrect. I like all the other professors I've had at UVA, but I would not recommend Prof Snider.", "Her teaching is strictly worse than reading the textbook yourself. She only copies grey boxes and some proofs from the book to the blackboard. She even needs to look at the note for simple algebras (e.g. solving linear equations). When not looking at the textbook, she only says \"I expect you to be able to do this,\" without explaining anything.", "Snider is a good instructor in that she gives clear, consistent explanations with lots of examples. She is not trying to be your friend, and has a 0 tolerance policy towards lateness, talking, eating, texting, laptop use. She is extremely condescending, there is no other way to put it. Be warned, the final is MUCH more difficult than the tests.", "AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! DARIA WILL MAKE YOU HATE MATH", "She has a condescending tone. She had generally inconvenient office hours. You are really going to have to try hard in this class.", "She teaches material effectively. Notation is VERY important in probability! Difference between lower case fx(x) and uppercase Fx(x) represent 2 totally different functions! So other criticism that she deducts for notation is unfair. shes good teacher. Shes generous with partial credit when you get problem wrong. She curves grades end of semester", "When studying for quizzes and tests, she tells the class to \"go for the understanding\". But when grading, she'll take points off for semantic errors even when it's clear the logical steps and answer are correct. She is incredibly condescending and impatient when answering students' questions in class. And she teaches almost directly from the book.", "She comes off as extremely elitist and demanding, but apparently she's actually nice in office hours. She does examples from the book... not really a good indication of what's on the test. She MAY make you feel like an idiot for asking a question; she has responded with comments like \"An 'A' student would know the answer to that question.\"", "Professor snider is a very good teacher. It is a hard class,  but I learned a lot. I sat in the front row and really tried, rather than complaining about the professor (many people enter with bad attitudes). Her class was not bad at all. Office hours are really helpful! I was in there every chance I got. She was not condescending, but very nice.", "Tough class. None of the professors were exceptional. Most of the comments about Prof. Snider are fairly accurate, though I don't think she intends to be condescending when answering questions, but her tone comes off that way.

Definitely better than Pisano or Guadani.", "What to say? You will find many similarities b/w all ratings of Snider and Giffen (name before married).

If you ask questions, rather than answering, she makes you feel incompetent. In lecture, you can literally finish her sentenses by reading the book.

Three weeks of pain. She reads the book for you and writes out the chapters on the board. She seems almost annoyed when you ask a question. You begin to feel that there are ONLY stupid questions.

Getting an A is hard as she does not curve but anyone in the top 50 percent is guaranteed a B. The test problems are usually similar to her practice problems so MCQ's usually make the difference between an A or B.", "Dr. Hatzell is a good choice for Thermodynamics at GT. Lectures were based upon the chapters in the book, and she hands out note packets for each section. Homework was time consuming, but Dr. Hatzell's office hours were a good resource. Tests were preceded by reviews and were based on the homework content, but were easier than the homework.", "Solid professor overall. She definitely seemed to accelerate the pace of the class as it went on so definitely try to stay ahead. Her tests are fair and mostly reflect slightly easier versions of HW questions. Multiple times, we had HW questions that werent possible without computer programs. Be sure to notify her if this is the case.", "She was super enthusiastic throughout the whole semester. You can tell she really enjoys teaching to the new generation. The homework took a long time for me to complete (6+ hours) and had it due about once a week. Tests were fair and weren't a blindside based on the lecture material. Also very kind and approachable for questions after class.", "Hatzell is a good professor overall, I enjoyed my experience taking Thermo.

Several times she lost the track of materials in the class. Assignments/projects were scattered around and the course objectives ware not clearly laid out. Also, office hours were too short.", "Professor Ansari thought me circuits in her first teaching semester. Tbh, she was one of my best professors ever. Very kind and caring, wants students to learn and be rewarded. Helps you understand. Extra credit opportunities. Tests are fair. LOTS of resources and preparation material (Worksheets, HW, practice). I'd definitely recommend", "Her classes are entirely disorganized. She never sticks to syllabus and rarely answers emails. The work itself isn't hard but there is no rubric or grading scheme. 3/4 of the lectures are student presentations and she rarely teaches any actual material.

She frequently emails students 2 days before class saying we all have to present on some topic. Over the semester, each person probably had to present about 15 times. When students talk about something they read in the book she acts surprised like she has never heard it before. All homework comes from the textbook", "Difficult to understand as she speeds through topics in rote fashion. Can't keep up unless you are already familiar with the material, but then what's the point of her teaching? Basically worthless if you are actually trying to learn something. You're better off studying a good textbook, otherwise, the class only serves to validate prior learning.", "The projects are the most difficult projects I have done in the grad school. There are 46 papers to read in the entire semester.

It can a lot of work, but go to every class, do all the homework, and study using the learning objectives and you can get a good grade.", "People give Kerr a hard time because they don't get the best grades with her.

She talks faster in her lectures than any human should ever be able to speak. Be prepared to \"infer\" (her words) what parts of the book you should be reading because the readings don't match the homework or the lectures and of course not the test.", "For me, Dr Kerr does not seem to grasp what she is talking about or communicate it very well. Maybe she has something going on elsewhere in her life but I have found her to be inarticulate and not especially helpful. Maybe it will improve... Here's hoping!", "She speaks fast in her lectures and didn't go as in depth on some topics as I would've liked. She very much expects you to come to class having read the blog and the textbook.

The PowerPoints have little text, and the book doesn't always cover everything you're expected to know (like in-class examples). That said, Dr. Kerr is a very dynamic and engaging lecturer. I didn't reach out for one-on-one help, but she answered the questions I did have fully and respectfully.", "I saw the other rating, and it's accurate. She appears nice and approachable but when contacted one-on-one does not care about the success or feelings of students. Also, her lectures are a little all over the place because she often loses her train of thought and often can't answer questions confidently.

I would definitely take her again!", "Her lectures were very clear.", "Class attendance counts as 3% of grade. Class is useless though. Lectures are kind of boring. Easy teacher. Tests are easy if you do the labs and understand the basics of it. Grades pretty easy too but its hard to get a 100 but not hard to get an A.", "Very nice and helpful. Understanding and cares about students. Very approachable. Overall a great teacher. Lectures are factored into your final grade. I don't know why though, because all lecture is for is to go over the powerpoint slides that are posted on T-Square. She also gives easier tests than the other sections.

The class was good.", "The tuesday lectures are insane i dont know what the heck the professors are talking about, although some of the material makes sense and is relevant.  I wouldn't take the course again because I find myself BSing everything I write; there is a lot of writing!  Johnson is nice, cool and helpful, although she is often scatterbrained. She grades easier as the semester gos on.", "Rebecca's lectures are dry and boring. She mainly reads off of powerpoints that are posted online before class and works through some practice problems with the class. While the class is boring and hard to sit through, she is sooo knowledgable about statistics. She is very smart, this class is just too easy to be interesting.", "Prof. Hehn is really nice, sweet, and good at explaining things. Office hours are helpful and there isn't much hw, just WebAssign each week and lab.

She loves group projects and unnecessary busy work. Do not take unless you have to.", "Genetics is not an easy class; it has a lot of busy work, which means you will ALWAYS have some sort of work to do, and the exams are extremely difficult, mainly because there's no partial credit. CC is a really entertaining professor who cares about her students but you should read the textbook and do practice problems and you'll do fine.", "Genetics is hard. You biology majors have to take it.

Even studying the book and problems inside and out will not prepare you for her fantastical & made-up scenarios on tests.", "good professor and very helpful", "horrible teacher. condescending and belittles student answers. takes an interesting subject and makes you hate it by the end of the course. tests are manageable but completely out of left field. Like in lecture, she asks questions, she expects answers on the tests that cover material she fails at covering herself. too bad u need it for the major.", "Her first 3 tests weren't really hard but the final was hard as hell. She ended up curving the class average down even though it was at a B- like she \"promised\". Even if you end up study hard be prepared to end up disappointed.", "She kept the classes very interesting but the questions on the tests had nothing to do with what we had done in class.

You do have to show up to answer learning catalytics questions and read the textbook, but if you do both of those it's almost impossible not to get an A.", "easy A/B+! yes you need to go to class, but the tests are generally fair and theres no final for EVSC 1450. She's super enthusiastic about climate change and i liked listening to her. she assigns a lot of homework, but its just busy work like short easy quizzes and forum posts to get you participation points. definitely recommend. dont buy the book", "By far my favorite professor at UVA. She is ALWAYS available and quick to email back. Obviously wants to work with students and learn from them, too. If you like environmental science, she would be a great advisor!", "The class appears to be easy, and the subject matter is not difficult, but the tests are tested on insignificant details. The lectures tend to be boring, but the guest lecturers are usually great. The curve is AMAZING!", "Easy. Professor is the BEST professor I have had here. She is very easy to understand and very kind. She truly loves the subject, and makes class interesting. She is always willing to help you. As long as you come to class and take notes during the lectures you will get a good grade. book helps solidify your understanding but isn't necessary", "She's a really nice person and is always there during office hours. You have to go to class to get notes she doesn't put on the powerpoints. Lectures are structured and tests are long but straightforward. I'd recommend this class.", "How do I begin to explain the terribleness of this class?  She made you come to lecutre by including stuff on the test that wasn't in the book.  Sleeping, however was the only option in lecture. The tests were SO hard witnessed by the 65-70 averages.  Scoring above the average is impossible if you are not hardcore about the material.  stay away!", "This class looked like it could've been a fun and interesting class, but I was definitely wrong.  This teacher is horrible, and her lectures have nothing to do with the tests.  Please save yourself the time and energy of taking this class.  I wish I would've known about her before I signed up!", "AVOID THIS CLASS!!! Terrible teacher, she is better at confusing herself than teaching you. Tests are ridiculous", "Deborah is a difficult grader, but makes it up by curving.  She is much better in a small class setting rather than the larger ecology lecture.  If you're interested in ecology, her work is interesting and she'll go out of her way to help you.  If you are not really interested in ecology, I would recommend Smith for 320.", "Deborah is nice and helps answer questions in office hours- COOL!  However, her tests were incredibly long and difficult.  She is confused herself when teaching which confuses you.  I studied my butt off, went to office hours & someone who never came to class got the same grade mysteriously.", "Didn't really like her teaching style, but she was always around if you needed help.", "Read the other frown face comments. I hate to be repetitive. The comments on the difficulty of tests and the amount of reading are quite true.", "This is the worst teacher I have had yet.  Is pregnant yet cancels class for several days due to having baby.  Tests are bs and material is unexpectedly pointless.

Statistics is not that difficult of a course, and she makes sure to cover the things you really need to know. She is very transparent about what will be on the exams. There is weekly online homework that is not difficult. Her exams are short, so each question is worth a lot.", "I never got the textbook, just took good notes on her lectures and paid attention to the homework and labs and got an A.

ALWAYS available outside of class if you need help.", "Maria is a pretty good lecturer and her class makes sense. She is upfront about the fact that there is no curve but most exams averaged about 77% mean anyway. If you pay attention, do the graded homework assignments, and study, this is a fairly easy class provided you're good at math.", "Maria is a really nice person, but not the clearest lecturer. Her slides are very clear, however, so it's not that important. She often seemed a little frazzled in class, but I think it was also because students only take this class for a requirement. Group projects were obnoxious, but there's only 2. TAKE THIS OVER STAT 2120! ", "Dr. Bociu although can be a bit intimidating at first is very nice and highly intelligent. I highly recommend attending her office hours as connecting with her will help you be successful in the course. We had at most one homework a week and a you can get by without reading any material which she doesnt enforce too much. Overall very great teacher", "In general Dr. Bociu is intelligent clear and interesting.  She upset me today, however, with a pop quiz. There is nothing about pop quizzes on the syllabus.   It felt more like punishment, an assertion of authority, rather than a constructive assessment.  She gave us little time and talked as we worked, as if to taunt us for not knowing it.", "She can NOT teach! She only does general problems and hardly any examples. She assigns too many problems for homework and her grading guidelines were not explained well! DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!", "Very intimidating, but don't let that discourage you. VERY helpful in office hours and one-on-one settings. Rather funny sense of humor, makes class interesting. Overall, material is tough but if you show any understanding and eagerness to learn it, she'll definitely pull you through with a decent grade.", "She knows the subject. However, calc II is very hard so only take it if you need it. And when you do take it, do the homework! And the webwork! It really helps on tests, cause they are hard even when you've studied for them. Do your best. She'll help you if you ask, and don't be afraid to say you don't understand something, she'll explain it again!", "She has a decent personality, but you really have to want to be in the class to do well. I was one of those who did not want to do the homework, mainly because it bored me to tears. It gets easier because you get used to it, but it doesn't get any more interesting.", "She can be intimidating and the class is not easy, but she prepares you well for the exam. If you survive the first couple of weeks, you'll be fine!", "Great teacher!!!  She is really concerned about how well her students understand the material, and she schedules office hours according to the most convenient times for her students. She even gave the class candy on special occasions!", "Like the guy before said, she is a really good teacher, but sometimes gets irritated with student questions.  However, that isn't too often, and I wouldnt take 132 with anyone else. Also, don't expect a good grade if you don't do the homework, our average on most of the tests was mid 70 but the people who did the HW always did much better than that", "Awesome professor - funny, witty, clear, knows her****, and knows how to get you to know it.  If you deserve an A in her class, she won't have a problem giving you an A, unlike some professors at the university.  I would also definitely hang out with her outside of class.  She rules.", "Lorena has a hot Romanian accent and a cute, witty style.  She's usually straight-forward and frank with her students which can turn into sassy, condescending remarks.  But laugh it off because it's worth listening to this bright foreigner differentiate the hyperbolic cosecant of x squared.", "very nice and always willing to help; really cares if students understand the material; not a very hard grader; was always entertaining; students in her class seemed to do better on the exams than other classes", "its calculus so don't expect her to make class interesting, but she's available for help if you have trouble with the material. she's also pretty cute which made class more tolerable", "She's a great teacher until the point when she starts getting irritated with her students.  She always has some funny stories to tell..so you'll enjoy that.  She likes helping so go to her office hours and she's a lenient grader which is awesome.", "Prof. Manson lectures like a storyteller, which connects the content of each lecture into an engaging, coherent takeaway. Her enthusiasm for biology is contagious. She cares about her students understanding the topic more than she values busy work or unnecessarily hard grades. 2200 was hard, but this upper level class is easy and fun!", "Manson gives a pretty good lecture and puts words on her slides, which is appreciated. Never went to her office hours since I didn't think it would be worth it, but overall pretty decent professor.", "I took population ecology with her and loved it! It seems that people are kind of 50/50 about her when she's teaching intro bio, but I would definitely recommend her for upper level bio classes. When she's teaching about things she loves, she's super engaging and friendly and takes the time to make sure you understand tougher concepts.", "Professor Manson is very bad professor who does not seem to care about the success of her students. Her lectures are unclear and she does not take the time to answer questions. I often read the textbook prior to class and prepared heavily for tests yet the questions were often confusing and unclear in how they were written.", "I thought Prof. Manson was about on par with Kittlesen (the other intro bio professor) in terms of test difficulty but her lectures were easier to follow. This class is about as much based on memorization as it is on application, so Quizlet is your friend. If you keep up with the (admittedly heavy) readings the class is fairly straightforward.", "Not the best prof. Record her lectures and take notes very carefully. Know everything she says in class in detail to the bare bone. I kid you not, there were questions on her exam that I thought she introduced in class \"just for fun\". Since the exams are filled with ambiguous questions, going to exam review afterwards can sometimes earn pts back.", "She is easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She genuinely cares that students do well; office hours are extremely helpful and she gives credit where credit is due. Not everybody likes the focus of her class, but it prepares you extremely well for upper-level courses. Test-heavy grades, but you learn so much.", "Despite her haphazard passion for BIOL 2200, Manson fails at engaging students. Her class is extremely plant focused, speeding through the human anatomy, and swooning over her love for all plants. Nonetheless, her style and Canadian butchering of English words is bearable if you're a good test taker. Tests are 80%.", "She is an amazing professor and is so excited when she teacher Biology. She is funny most of the time, and always makes the lectures interesting. She is a real gem. She is always available to talk and is the best Biology teacher I had here at UVA.", "It's the first class that I ever finished auditing from the beginning to the end. Ruth has a very strong background between hardware and software, and she has experienced the whole process from using assembly language to C and she was like an electrical engineer who works in the CS.

To the point. Knows her stuff! Pays attention to students and really cares about them. The best prof and advisor EVER! :)", "Had her for 216, then took 415 again with her. She is just fantastic. One of the best profs I've had at UVA. Even went out of her way to talk with me about grad school and research opportunities. I learned a lot in both classes I've taken with her. Very friendly and nice.", "She's the best CS professor in the department. Her lectures are clear, and she will help out any student who doesn't understand the material. Her assignments were fair in difficulty. The course material is pretty interesting and fun sometimes. She's a very friendly and knowledgeable professor too.", "Very intersting class. If you start on the labs BEFORE the night before, then you will be fine, I find the labs to be very helpful. Also, do the practice exams and you will do just fine on the real ones. Great class and teacher.", "My impression was that her lectures are good, but labs are bad. Labs are just plain too hard; a lot of the later ones are huge projects that most other classes would make long-term assignments (ie: greater than a month), but you have to do them in just a week for her class.", "placed too much emphasis (grade-wise) on assembly programming", "She is amazing! I learned SO much in her class! She really makes the material interesting and the labs and exams reflect exactly what was in the lecture. Later labs are longer and harder so be prepared! A GREAT professor! One of the best in CS!", "Class could have been much worse.Tends to have you do things by hand on tests versus programming.No one does a post/pre/in order traversal or insertion of elements by hand on a tree.Covers data structures well and how to speed up algorithms using them.", "Better than other teachers I've had, but not exceptional. Organized lectures.  Boring labs. Helps to have some background in the material.", "Doesn't stand out in any one area, but is good all around.", "One of the better CS professors at UVA, but that's not saying a lot...", "impossible class to get an A in.

She makes cool CS topics boring.", "Probably very smart lady,lectures are worthless though,it's here first year here", "Professor Roach has been one of my very favorite professors I have had the privelege to take. Attending her class was a joy! I feel like this course not only increased my knowlege of the subject material but also made me a more efficient student and significantly improved my data interpretation skills. I would highly recommend this class!", "Human epitome of a computer. Very challenging for an intro to programming class.  Careful taking this class without previous coding experience. Homework is weighted the same as exams and is graded strictly. ", "Not a good teacher, especially for an intro to Python coding class where no prior experience is expected. In a class for people with no coding experience, she taught as if everyone knew basic code, but we didn't. Her responses to questions were harsh, and she basically called people stupid if they couldn't figure it out. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.", "I definitely recommend Carolyn! She is extremely helpful and willing to help her students any way she can. Her notes are very clear, and she uses examples that aren't already in the textbook. Additionally, I didn't need to use the textbook at all. Her grading is very fair. Take her class!", "She is an absolutely wonderful Calc teacher. She is very helpful, and although classes might seem extremely long, you learn what you need to learn. Her notes are very clear- I haven't used the book all year. Definitely recommend her as a teacher.", "carolyn really wants to help her students and she does everything she can so that they understand and get a good grade on her tests. she's very nice and definitely knows how to teach calculus. i would recommend having her as a calculus professor.", "seriously awesome, she was so nice and very helpful, fair with quizzes and exams, take her for calc!", "Carolyn is young, sweet and dedicated to her students. More than fair in her grading, she really tries to make sure you knows what's going on and is extremely helpful in office hours. Definitely recommend her for this course.", "Very friendly and easy teacher. Prepares you very well for the exams and even makes classes interesting and calculus not too painful to learn (or re-learn). I heard some horror stories about other teachers for 1210 but Carolyn was great.", "Simply the worst professor I have ever had. Whether it was yelling at a student for half an hour because the student had multiplied x*y instead of y*x without seeming to realize the two are the same or claiming she could not give higher than a B because she had not assigned enough work to justify it I have never seen a prof more incompetent or mean", "The best professors I ever had. Harder than heck, no doubt about it, but outside of the classroom I found her very helpful. She demands the very best of people and will not settle for less. That being said, by the end of the semester everyone produced better work than ever. She's teaching a lot more than the material. Took 4 semesters with her", "Bass is reasonable; gives us real-world examples with practical applications; she's tough, but does it for our good; she was helpful to me and is an asset to UVa; she has more funding than prof. in the department.", "Given that so many students find her useless in teaching and unhelpful outside the classroom, the school really needs to find someone to replace her in order to maintain the quality of the education Systems Engineering students experience", "Pretty useless half of the semester.  We could have covered the same amount of material in two weeks.  It was too repetitive.", "No Comments", "She is so kind.  She makes little jokes in class and genuinely wants you to succeed.  Grades very generously, even made our final exam optional. Weekly homework from the textbook which isn't too difficult, weekly quiz in discussion which is made up of problems directly from the homework, 3 exams, and a final. She speaks quietly so sit in the front!", "Dr. Lasiecka along with Dr. Wang were two of my best proffessors at UVA ever. Not only they were great but as human beings they are angels sent from heaven. I loved both of them dearly. If you ever have to take MATH 331 or MATH 354 take them with one of them. I promise you that you will do good.", "She's so lovely. Be warned, she does speak softly. But she makes up for that with her clarity. She does a lot of hw problems for you during the course. This is a very clear, easy math course.

She speaks softly and moves quickly.

From what I hear, she's better than the other diff-eq teachers out there.", "In class, she kinda isn't the best. (often elaborates on parts you understand, shows you something but then immediately the answer without giving you a change to think it through. small scribbly handwriting on chalk, etc.) BUT: She is VERY outgoing and very willing to help you out. Has deadlines but will give credit if your willing to work for it.", "CS 1113 with professor Asma was a nightmare. This class was filled with many unnecessarily hard homeworks/classworks/tests, she didn't teach us what we needed to complete labs (TA's had to teach us), and she did not know how to lecture.

Much more busywork than other 1620 sections with draconian high-school rules: no phones, mandatory attendance, no talking. Yes, she'll dock your grade. Endless group work (not hard, just way too much of it). In the end, frustrating and futile.", "She was awesome.

The material was tough but I don't regret the course at all!", "Dr. Telesnitsky was not a bad lecturer, but not that impressive either. Does seem a bit rushed when lecturing.

She also offers a lot of extra credit opportunities in case you bomb a quiz. The final was challenging but not impossible.", "Not the greatest at teaching. Her classes are boring. She makes 1 hour class feel like 2 hours. Her lec slides are the worst I have ever seen, with no info at all.

Just have to pray she doesn't choose to make it hard this time.", "Sevener is really clear about material presented in class. There's nothing surprising or tricky on exams. All of the lectures for this class were recorded, so it was fine to skip class and just watch those. This was an information-heavy course, so mostly memorization.

Let you help you understand this.\"", "Keeps lecture engaging by encouraging class participation and having in-class worksheets (graded on effort) to reinforce concepts.

Not as good as Prof Sick, occasionally got things wrong, graded very harshly.", "Professor Sevener is fantastic. Questions about material: great responses, very straightforward. Questions about assignments: makes you work for it, which I appreciate. Refers you to other profs if she is unable to answer your questions. Would highly recommend for any class.", "The lectures are very clear, and Prof. Sevener always tells you what she expects you to know.

She also was one of the least approachable profs - not willing to argue test questions or answers or topics whatsoever", "Pavgi writes notoriously challenging exams - to do well you essentially have to go through all lecture recordings and write down every word she says as she'll test you on things she verbalizes that aren't on the slides. Very clear in class, though, and has been teaching long enough to know exactly what to say to help you understand the concepts.", "Shes pretty good once you get used to her.", "One of my favorite profs here at Michigan.

She's hilarious though without realizing it.", "Grade was 100% exam based and all the exams were 100% based off of the lectures. My textbook is buried underneath a mound of dust. Go to lecture for the iClicker points but the only way you can actually learn the material is by watching the lecture recordings since Pavgi goes very fast. Take notes on EVERYTHING she says even if its not on the slide", "The tests are the most confusing things ever. You think you know everything there is to know, but then you get hit with Pavgi's \"All of the above, A & B, A & C, all but B\" questions. She has said a couple funny things, but she talks so fast and confusingly that you can't keep up.", "Exams are poorly worded and refuses to consider other option choices. iClicker is extra credit so I suggest going to lecture. Memorize the slides (lots if info), no need to read the book. Disrespectful/snarky at times but does decent job teaching but sometimes glosses over stuff that shows up on the exam.", "Her lectures are very boring and her exams consist of about 50 multiple choice questions. The MC can get confusing cause many of them consist of answer choices like C: All of the above, D: A and B, etc, so make sure you know your material. Memorize the lecture slides (MEMORIZE THEM), you don't need to do the readings to do well on the exams.", "Dr. Pavgi is a great professor and a genius. Though sometimes confusing, she is hilarious. I laugh out loud at all of her jokes.", "She was good enough for the first exam, explained stuff relatively clearly and it was studyable even though the exam was hard and there were unfairly worded questions. She has become a whole different professor for the second exam. Useless lectures, focuses on the least relevant material and its completely unclear what we need to know for the exam.", "Not only does Professor Pavgi put together a meaningless course where no real concepts are taught and no novel intellect is gained, but she is also one of the most disrespectful professors I've encountered. She shows minimal regard for her students and often makes snarky comments when in lab. She lacks professionalism and just downright compassion", "Terrible professor. Has no regard or respect for students. Is a presumptuous and condescending woman, harboring a heartless soul. Students despise her and comment on what an outrageously hard heart she holds and believes she is above anyone and everyone.", "Super easy class, just memorize slides and you're golden!", "PLEASE do yourself a favor and take this class with Dr Pavgi. I had the chance to sit through some of the other proffer's who taught this course, and without a doubt Dr Pavgi was the best! Exams are not as easy but if you work hard they are manageable!", "Absolutely loved Dr. Pavgi's class. She taught everything in such an amazing way. Very easy to understand. You have to put the time in for this class and study the material, but the exams are very straightforward. She is not trying to trick you. Easy to do well in if you put in the effort. One of my favorite classes I've taken at umich", "Dr. Pavgi is great! Her tests are more than fair, very straightforward. You don't have to read the textbook at all, everything is based on her lectures. It would benefit you to attend class b/c she gives extra credit clicker questions that could really help you. Best way to study is to just re watch the lectures & take notes. Very manageable class!", "pavgi was alright. the tests were hard but if you studied you should have been fine. She's confusing in lecture so I would even recommend to just look over the powerpoints on your own time. but sometimes i wondered if she ever read her exams before she printed them...", "Lectures were terrible. Complete lack of organization,  gives convoluted explanations of concepts, always going from one concept to the next with little to no connections. This makes the class harder since it's entirely lecture based. Exams cover lecture material, but poor wording/grammar of questions makes them far more difficult than necessary.", "While Dr. Pavgi is a nice person, she is not a good lecturer by any means. Her lectures (and notes) were incoherent and disorganized which made studying for lectures difficult. The content would otherwise be interesting but the delivery is so bad that it's hard to appreciate. Do NOT recommend, you should take it another semester with another prof.", "Dr. Pavgi, while not the best lecturer, cares an incredible amount about her students. Animal Phys is content heavy, but if you take the time to go to OHs and go over your exams/study skills, you will see results. I didn't want to follow her advice at first because I was convinced I knew how to study, but now I'll never study another way again.", "She is a good lecturer and the lectures are recorded so you can go back and watch them to catch details you missed. I HIGHLY recommend going to class though. You can earn extra points that way. The class is entirely exam based and the questions are very detailed. Lots of studying required. If you put the time in, you'll be fine.", "Teacher has a great enthusiasm for her subject. Teaches clearly and allows students to give feedback on lectures. Encourages questions, curiosity, and discovery.", "Professor Koch really cares about education, at least comparable and even more than high school teachers. Very well-prepared lectures and helpful office hours.", "Sarah is very smart and knows the subject inside and out. Her enthusiasm was infectious; this was a truly great course!!", "This was one of my favorite classes so far at UMich. Prof is a very nice person and gives great lectures. Lots of homework in this class, and the tests were a little long. Other than that, it was a perfect class!", "An excellent teacher! Sarah developed a very clear, geometric understanding of each concept before going into the details of the proofs. Also, she was often available outside of class for help.", "I took math 490 with her last semester and it was superb. She is super caring and helps me a lot outside of classroom. Really genius person and I can feel her passion for teaching and for topology. Highly recommended. If you work hard, you will get a good grade. She checks her email pretty often and will always love to help you if you have question", "I really really love Sarah and the way she organize the IBL lecture. Honestly, it is quite easy and just an intro level class to topology, but I still learn something from the last several lectures.I will strongly recommend it for students who are not in pure math and not recommend it for math students. Math students should take 590.", "The happiest professor I've ever had! Sarah (she'd rather you not call her Professor Koch) really cares that you care about math. She gives great intuition--math is a very visual subject for her. To benefit from her class, be engaged in learning. She gives a lot of work, but is a super nice person. If you're struggling, go to office hours.", "I absolutely love Sarah; she goes far out of her way to help students. Very understanding and caring. Though her lectures may not be very linear, the general point is not hard to follow and she takes time to explain each concept in depth.", "She has a very unclear way of teaching, and the homework is filled with random stuff.", "Sarah is very kind, and very helpful during office hours. Her lectures are engaging, but the notes she writes on the board are not very organized which makes taking notes difficult. Her tests are quite fair, and her p sets would be a lot more interesting if she didn't accept input from her students that desire more computation. Overall great prof.", "Not so clear as DeBacker. However, she is most willing to help.", "Dr. Jakob's slides are much clearer and better formatted than Dr. B's, but the pace of her lectures is much slower. Her project assignments required lots of work, and she was often unclear in her speech during lecture. The material she presents that contains outside applications does appear on exams, so make sure to understand it.", "Dr. Jakob is eccentric and unique, but truly cares about her students. She is the first teacher ever whose office hours I've attended, and she truly made it worth it with how clearly and concisely she explains information. Biochem is a tough class, but put in the right effort with Dr. Jakob and you'll reap the fruit on her exams", "Ursula was a great professor. She really engages with the class and tries to get them involved with the material by walking around cold-calling during lectures. She is actually very funny too and tries to joke around. That being said, sometimes how she explains material is confusing, but she will try her best to reexplain if students do not get it.", "Her lectures are not super clear, however, her slides are perfectly laid out. Makes memorizing easier. She walks down the aisle and makes people participate in lecture, so either sit far away or don't make eye contact.", "She's not the worst or the best professor I've had. BioChem is going to be a tough class no matter what and she was an okay teacher. Her flow of information was a little off in lecture and she was definitely confusing. But, she was nice and approachable. She's not as bad as some commentors are making her out to be, but she's not that great either.", "Dr. Jakob is a super nice professor who genuinely cares about teaching.  She's pretty clear in lecture and helpful during office hours.  Definitely the more likable one between her and Dr. B.  ", "Jakob is 10x better than Balazovich. She cares about her students, she explains material clearly, and she will always pause to re-explain herself if the class is struggling to understand a concept. She will ALWAYS tell you exactly what you need to know and study to get through the class.", "Don't really understand the negative comments, Jakob was a good professor who explained the material well and in a relatively simple way ", "I feel many people who rate on this site have a negative impression of professors who teach difficult classes (particularly pre med classes!). Biochem was a tough class, but Ursula explained concepts well the majority of the time. Yes, you needed to know almost everything on her slides, but that shouldn't be surprising for a biochem class.", "Everyone here needs to calm down. Ursula is an amazing professor and always willing to help in her office hours. She makes things easy to understand- but you have to put in some work yourself! No one said biochem was going to be easy, you really have to study. Her exams were fair- she tested over exactly what she said she would.", "nice lady who doesn't stress concepts that will be heavily tested, and rather tells us useless things we don't need to know. wouldn't even tell us the avg for exam 3 because it was so low, im guessing. the reason for the low avg correlates to her teaching ability.", "I disagree with the post below.  She is actually a nice person and cares about how you do in the class.  She is clear in lecture and tries her best to help recap what you should know/study.  Overall, I liked her more than the other prof for this class.", "This lady absolutely cannot teach. Do not take this class with her. Exams are poorly worded and set up to fail you. They test the most minute details. She rushes through lecture slides every day and simply does not care about student performance. She's there simply to be there, not to truly care and teach and make a difference.", "Although she is a German, but I could understand her English no problem (unlike some Indian prof. in the University). Very helpful to students and answer question emails quickly. If you read her slides and refer to textbook, you will be totally fine for the class. Persons who gave her bad ratings probably just want good grades without studying.", "Ten chapter in 2 classes?  She cannot and should not teach.  She does not care about student performance or learning.  Obscure test questions not covered in class.  You teach yourself.", "She is not nearly as bad as the previous comments describe. I found her questions to be easier than Dr. Bs. Her accent isn't that bad, or even comparable to half the math department.", "So they expect to give you in this class the whole world of biochemistry in 3.5 months....this is one of my worst classes ever...i struggled so much and you should take this class solo in a semester if u wanna do good.tests have hard questions that u never expect they would've asked abt b4 the test. Teacher is nice  ,class is hard", "She lets the graduate students make mistakes on grading. She would not give me credit even though my answers were correct. She takes off 5 points for units which are already given in the question. She lost my regrade and told me to stop wasting her time asking about.  IMHO she is one of the worst person I've dealt with.", "Worst teacher at michigan. Its OK to be hard but its not OK to be confusing and teach crap and then make mistakes on grading", "Absolutely horrible. Will not discuss grading scale. The previous person is right! Rude and the accent makes the class unbearable.", "Very confusing. When I was in office hours, she was very condescending and expected me to know my answers. Hello, if I knew, I wouldn't ask! In fact I saw two students come in to get their forms signed so they could drop the class. This just shows you how bad it is.", "Dr. Jakob is very approachable. The class is do-able despite what ppl say. It is easy to understand her, ppl that say otherwise are deaf. Just make sure you read and KNOW the lecture slides! Definitely possible to get an A just attend lecture and read the book. Exams are geared towards detail but the detail comes from the notes not the book.", "No Comments", "Good instructor.  Pointless to go to class except for a few MCAT practice questions.  Memorize the notes and refer back to the textbook if you have any questions.  Requires a lot of time.", "Nice lady. Her german accent wasn't that bad. She's pretty straightforward and doesn't try to trick you on exams. Her slides are slightly messy, but really tell you what to focus on. She makes jokes in lectures and they are actually funny, but her lectures could be really boring at times...", "Hard class, really nice lady, though, and was more than willing to help students. Little difficult to understand her accent, but all her lecturenotes were online.", "She is really hard to understand because she has a strong German accent, but she is funny and sweet.  Everything you need to know is on her lecture slides and she is very straight forward.", "She is really nice and very funny in lecture. She doesn't go as fast as Balazovich, which is nice. She only wants you to know the very basics of biochemistry and does not try to trick you on the quizzes/exams at all. Very straightforward, even if her powerpoints are slightly messy.", "Very strong accent which made it hard to understand her. She was helpful and friendly to approach compared to Satan (Balazovich), but she was vague to questions. I would also like t suggest picking out new GSIs whom don't state on the first day, \"I don't care about you since I am going to med school and you aren't\" to the discussion class.", "Biochemistry professor. She was clear, and lectures were kept as interesting as possible. Friendly professor who answered emails quickly.", "Not particularly difficult. My issue is directed more at the IOE department for placing more than 3 midterms for core classes over the same week. I got a lower score on the midterm, and it's going to hurt me a lot since exams are worth 80% of your grade. Other downside is you don't really learn anything practical or hands-on (no projects).", "The exams are worth a lot. That is the downside to the class. She teaches very clearly, and repeats material if needed to make sure everyone is on the same page. There are many pop quizzes, but most are moderately easy. I would definitely take another class with her again. She is very clear, and lectures are well organized.", "Very sweet professor. Starts every lecture by reviewing past few classes and derivations. Exams and homeworks are straightforward.", "Clear lecture notes. You can get good grades without going to class.", "Class is extremely easy. Exams are easy and very similar to practice exams.  Homework is completely out of the book", "Very nice lady; has an Asian accent so takes a second to follow but not incomprehensible.  Grades fairly easily, material is relatively straightforward, and exams are open-book, open-note.  Also gave us a couple of bonus point opportunities, including class attendance.", "She had really detailed lecture slides. Her lectures helped explain everything real well. The best part is that exams were OPEN NOTE AND OPEN BOOK. It doesn't matter how the professor is at that point, its a great class.", "She prepared very carefully and orderly. I did not know why so many bad comments on her!! She is originally Korean, I guess. But not easy to get A, we need to write FAST in exam!!", "From hearing others' reactions to the class last semester and taking the class this semester, I think the class has changed a lot. I really like the professor and find lectures to be extremely helpful. I know there was a lot of criticism before, but honestly I don't think it applies anymore.", "I really don't understand the bad reviews.  She's great at teaching and is nice to her students.", "For starters, she is pretty much incomprehensible. Then she does examples that seem to have no relevance to the class. On top of them not being relavent, it takes her ages to go through them. Her powerpoint slides are also terrible. Also, she was given midterm feedback on how to change, and took none of the feedback at all. AVOID!", "Absolutely brutal. lectures were useless because she was impossible to understand. her examples were useless, and she made the exam nothing like the homework or examples. Her lecture slides are full of gibberish that she barely explains and when asked to give examples, she literally wouldnt. Half the class dropped after the first exam. Have fun", "she gives clear explanation; but gets upset if we don't get it afterwards...", "terrible... lacks understanding of fundamental physical concepts, or ability to explain more advanced concepts, yet gets frustrated if we don't get it", "she seems very serious in work and hilarious outside and very kind and beatifull", "She was not explained content well. She is not interested in the teaching. Lacked a clear explanation of her grading and was not clear on what she required for full credit.", "Great professor. Very knowledgeable about the subject. Always open and really wants everyone to do well. Works out problems by hand on the board instead of using awful ppt. Is a bit feisty though and will often get upset if the class is responding slowly to her questions. Workload is a bit high but the class was straightforward for the most part.", "Excellent professor. Clear explanations that are illustrated with lots of examples. Emphasizes learning over grades. Homeworks can be long, but are directly related to lecture material and really help you learn the concepts. Challenging, but fair exams. A little stern at times, but very kind overall. Helpful during office hours. Highly recommended!", "Very knowledgeable. a little on the stern side but can lighten up a bit. always looking to help and lays down a distinct process for analysis", "I love. She makes Analog Circuits easy to understand. The exams are directly taken from practice tests, HWs and lectures. Just do everything required of you and you will find this class straightforward", "smart lady.. stern for no reason.", "Nice professor, although she is sometimes inconsistent.", "She's a great GSI, who ran our lab.  She's been teaching this class for 2 years now, and is fantastic.  She knows her stuff.  Just ask her about aphids!  :)", "All the professors are FANTASTIC, and the class is super interesting. The first exam is easy, and the last two they make you work for it to say the least. Fuller's exam is open note, and pretty detailed as a result, but fair. Make sure you make lots of charts for easy-access info, and bring your laptop to control F!! Definitely recommend this class", "Had several classes with Dr. Fuller as part of our graduate program . She is very knowledgable and an expert in her field. She is very responsive when it comes to answering student questions and sets reasonable expectations for exams. I feel very prepared for all material concerning viruses on our boards after all of the classes I had with her.", "Professor Fuller is scattered, does not present the information clearly, and is not on the students side.  Regularly, a student will ask an interesting question, just to have Professor Fuller say that the question is not the point of the slide and repeat what the point of the slide it.  Her test are ambiguous, and she is not willing to change this.", "I LIKE THE TEACHER", "She is a good teacher, but some may find her a little hard to understand with her accent. She answers questions thoroughly, but otherwise she basically uses examples from the book and asks us to do problems in class. The exams are rough but the curve is usually really high. Web homework isn't mandatory but it is good practice.", "Dr. Raji is the epitome of what you don't want in a professor.  She definitely does not care about the students, is rude, and does not respond to emails that are of top importance.  As a matter of fact, I was hospitalized, and only after involving the department chair did Dr. Raji assist with my situation.   AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.", "Dr. Raji was a very interesting and knowledgeable teacher. She was very helpful and willing to spend time answering any questions students might have. I had very little experience with biology prior to taking BIOLOGY 172 with Dr. Raji, and she made it a very manageable and enjoyable experience.", "She was willing to help if you needed it, and cared about her students. The exams were very tricky & difficult. Sometimes we got points back for mistakes she made. Bio 172, like all the other Intro classes, is very difficult to get an A in. Definitely join an SLC study group and try to review the material as you go.", "Easily the best professor in Biology at UM.  Wish we had more professors like her in this department/University.  She deserves to be a full-time professor if she is not one already.  Dr. Raji cares for the students and ensures that they understand the material. There are other useless lecturers in this department who do not belong here.", "Exams poorly worded, contain many mistakes, and do a mediocre job of testing the material. Interrupts constantly  during exams to correct mistakes SHE made. Misleading, vague notes. She treats classes like a game and students have to argue for well deserved points. Is sneaky when calculating grades and changes the scale. May not give deserved grade", "Dr Raji was a very clear, kind lecturer. She made an effort to learn many of the names of students both in the front of the class as well as the middle and back of the class which made a big lecture feel small. Her exams were not the best written exams in the world but that should improve. Overall she had great intentions and I recommend her to all", "Absolutely agree with the comment below. The overall average in the course was a 76%, and she DIDNT CURVE THE CLASS. Meaning the average grade was a C for the course overall. An absolutely nice teacher at heart but an absolutely terrible test maker as the wording was absurd and she had to correct herself at least 10 times during each exam period.", "Everyone who already rated for Spring 2011 didn't wait until their final score came in. Firstly, Raji is a very nice woman and approachable. She made wording mistakes on her exams and gave us back points on multiple occasions. However, to make up for the high average due to her mistakes, she made the last exam extremely difficult and unreasonable.", "Once of the nicest professors I've had. She was able to answer just about ever question we had on the material. My only complaint is that the exam questions were often poorly worded, or they covered things that weren't in class. But Dr. Raji did give points back on some, and you will learn a lot regardless of your grade. Oh, and use the textbook.", "Dr. Raji was a great professor.  She should be invited to come to the University to teach full time.  When I took Bio 172 the first time, I had two awful professors. Dr. Raji is much better than both of them.  She should really teach here full time.  She's great!", "I love Dr. Rajia nd she honestly made me fall in love with biology. She knows her material and she does a wonderful job at teaching it. She is amazing and I don't  think I would have ever enjoyed this course with anyone else. I would take another class with her in a heart beat.", "Dr. Raji is amazing at what she does. She knows her subject and does a wonderful job of teaching it. I took Bio 172 with her this spring and I really hope to see her teaching another course here again <3 she is amazing.", "Great professor, works with students and makes sure concepts are understood.  Very approachable and has an extensive knowledge of molecular and cellular biology.", "Dr. Raji  made lecture fun to go to and the learning environment was very comfortable. She explained things in a clear matter and when she made mistakes she was not afraid to admit them (happened a few times on exams). I can honestly say that she is one of favorite science professors. She knows the material very well and makes you interested!", "Dr. Raji is the best professor I have ever encountered. She has a way with teaching. You see her love for the subject, for teaching, for her students from lecture to lecture. I would take any course she will teach and I hope to see her at U of M for microbiology. I can never be too thankful for her teaching methods. She is amazing!", "The best professor that I have taken at the University of Michigan and I am a sophomore so I have seen many professors and she ranks as number 1.", "Dr. Raji has an amazing style of teaching. She is very clear and helpful. With honesty she is one of the few U of M professors that has really taught me something, challenged me and made biology so interesting. You see her love for the subject, for teaching, for students lecture after lecture. She is very positive and cares that her students learn.", "Her lecture is very organized. She made the material really interesting. We finish lecture usually half an hour early in the spring term but she always leaves time for questions and exam reviews. Raji knows what she talks about and knows the material well.", "Very good professor.  Unlike a previous bio course i took, she made the course VERY interesting.  I heard bad things about the class, but I actually enjoyed the material.  I hope she teaches more classes in the future.  Highly recommended.", "One of the bext professors that I have had in my college life.  Her knowledge of the subject and her teaching style are just fantastic.  I would recommend her for any one wishing to take this class", "One of the bext professors that I have had in my college life", "She's so salty and always throws temper tantrums in office hours.", "Not a great professor, but in EECS183 you can attend any lecturer you want, so don't worry if you get stuck with her. All lectures are recorded as well. She is very considerate in office hours, but is not a great lecturer...", "Not too difficult of a class but she was both a bad teacher and a bad person. Least favorite professor I have had at UofM.", "She's one of those people who thinks she's strong and bold, but is in reality just rude and very bitter.", "My group for the final project went to meet with her because even the IAs couldn't find the problem with our code. She was condescending and ended up yelling at us and blaming us for not understanding concepts. Interestingly enough, the concept was something we had never even learned before... I would go to another professor if you have questions.", "Terrible teacher. Always very rude and unhelpful.", "Let's just say that Nic Cage speaks at a more consistent volume.  Lectures can get pretty boring.  One time one of the other EECS 183 lecturers subbed for us and that was pretty good.  I'd say go for another lecturer if you can but it won't impact your grade at all.  Super easy class", "Definitely pay attention to the reading. That's how I learned all the material for the class. Her lecture is very boring and discussion is basically useless. Find friends to work on the projects with and don't get too hung up on exam grades. Start projects and assignments early of you WILL regret it. Overall, fun class!!", "EECS 183 is easily the most frustrating class I've ever taken.  The lecture slides, as well as the online supplement material, covers a bare minimum of how implement code correctly.  The office hours are an absolute mess; if you don't have hours to dedicate to getting one question answered, don't waste your time going.  Don't take this class.", "I went to her OH and started to doubt myself. She was so rude and didn't provide any helpful advice at all.", "Went to her OH twice. First time, I had no idea what to do for a project and she was very rude about explaining anything. It was like she couldn't possibly understand why I was confused about anything on that project. Second time, I had a large part of another project done (thanks to the GSIs), and she was much nicer and helpful with my questions.", "She can come off as rude, snobbish, or unhelpful , but ultimately she really wants to help students learn and be successful in one of the most challenging fields offered at Michigan. Work hard, stay on top of the material, form a study group, make a good team on the final project and you'll have a great experience.  I really liked her and the class", "Her manner of speaking is extremely annoying, and she is quite rude and unhelpful in general. The class is pretty easy though, and thankfully, the rest of the staff is fantastic.", "She's so. rude.", "Dorf is the LEAST helpful professor I have ever had.  Her answers to students' questions are vague and often condescending.  She over complicated simple concepts and wastes class time on unrelated topics. The projects are boring and extremely exact.  Nearly impossible to complete without going to OH.  Very happy this class is over.", "Dorf is extremely unsupportive and unpleasant to be around. She  makes a big deal about how \"coding is for everyone\" blah blah but if you have questions, she often makes you feel inferior. Her emails and comments on Piazza are very rude. Its time for her to retire honestly. Don't go to Dorf for help with this class, the IA's are your best bet.", "Dorf isn't the best lecturer but you don't have to worry about her tbh. The IAs and Office Hours are the lifeblood of this class. Go to office hours and start early! Can't stress this enough! You will do well if you do that. Overall, really great class. It's set up extremely well and the projects are fun! I recommend it to everyone!", "She's super annoying and is rude. If you ask for help and you don't know the answer she will be angry and is a very unpleasant person to be around.", "One of the best teachers I've ever had - and definitely the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable programming instructor I've ever met. Really supportive/proud of her students. Make sure to not miss any lectures if you don't have to; do all of the CodeLab exercises/practice tests, and you'll be sure to do well in the class!", "A very unpleasant and unhelpful person. Treats all students as if they don't know the meaning of hard work.", "Her lectures are long and sometimes boring. Most of the learning came from the online interactive textbook we used. I went to lectures just for clicker points. She is really not involved much outside of her lectures but the rest of her EECS 183 staff is incredible and always there to help", "She's really annoying to listen to but the class is really easy if you're willing to put in the time it takes to get the work done. Start projects as soon as you can in order to get extra credit, and do the readings, because that's basically how you learn the material.", "I initially thought EECS 183 was pretty hard, but I realized that I was having difficulty in the course mainly because Dorf's lectures were unclear and disorganized. Attend a different lecture if you can.", "This class gives the liberty of letting you go to any lecture you want, so don't stress if you don't like her. I was completely new to coding, and this class aided to that.  Use all the resources available, don't wait until the last minute (i.e. online videos, office hours, discussion), it's only hard if you don't seek help.", "Tough class if you're new to programming. I realized I hated coding by the end of it. Dorf is definitely not one of the best professors that taught this class but you can always attend a different lecture.", "A mediocre teacher who is very condescending during office hours. The class was easy, but Dorf's attitude towards students was despicable.", "This class is pretty difficult, especially if you have never coded before.  It's a weeder class, and a lot of people drop after the first test.  The class consists mostly of group projects which with hard work and long hours are doable.  I went to tutoring with GSI's all the time just to get a B.  The tests are almost impossible.", "Please do NOT be afraid of 183. It is my favorite class since arriving at Michigan. Dorf's lectures are sometimes a bit disorganized, but you'll be fine. There's Extra Credit attached to every project for turning things in earlier, and the exams aren't that hard. Study and go to office hours and you probably won't get less than a B. ", "Long story short I realized I hated coding by the end of the semester and the workload gets unbearable if you really aren't into it. My advice is to take enough credits so that you can drop this class and still be full-time. Some of the staff is helpful but as a whole they are overrated because the large amount of students make it hard to get help.", " She definitely cares about her students. Multiple points through the semester she sent emails out to the class with people wanting to hire people out of 183. Dorf isn't the best, but I don't understand a lot of the ragging on her bc if you don't like her you can just go to another lecture. 183 is run like 1 big class. Section is optional too. ", "Very, very dry lectures that are word for word from the readings. Grading is crazy; you need a 95% for an A. The GSIs taught most of the class and the professor was frequently absent from class. Such a shame since the material was actually pretty interestingthe format it was presented in was anything but that.", "Knowledgeable in the field, but not a very good lecturer. Course content is interesting and relevant, but lectures are usually dry. Attending the class really doesnt gain you much because the lectures are mainly her reading verbatim off of the slides.", "Get ready for lots of cold calling and other scare tactics to get you to participate", "There was a lot of information during lecture, but she recorded lectures and put them on Canvas. Homework was graded tough and it was not clear what answer they wanted. Grading on exams was lenient. If you put the work in to learn the information, you will do well. There are quizzes, but we went over them as a class.", "You certainly have a lot of material to remember. Coming from a material's science background, I'm used to using engineering/intuition/math. This reminded me of AP Bio. You will learn a lot in this class, and if you have any interest in Biomaterials, take it! Good cross-over whether you're BME intersted in MSE or vice-versa", "She expects you to memorize each of her slides to a T. The exams were extremely difficult even though she let us use cheat sheets. I didn't know how to answer any of the questions on the final and had no clue how the grading in the class worked. She made us do group presentations on science papers. Too much work. Avoid taking this with Dr. Mehta.", "Way too much information presented in each lecture and too much material expected to know", "She gives wrong information in class and if you put that on the homework/exam you get marked wrong. If you ask for a regrade saying \"this is what you told us\" it won't matter since all of the grading is at the GSIs desecration. This class has some amazing information, but do not take it with Dr. Mehta", "Tough and too much workload. The class had a journal club thing where teams of students presented a journal they read. It may be a good way to push us to read scientific papers, but it is ridiculous to have you memorize what's in 15 papers presented throughout the semester and prepare for any possible questions from any of them for the exam.", "Good teacher, nice, tells you exactly what is going to be on the test", "she was a great teacher, she really cares about her students, emphasizes what we do and dont have to know for the test, shes an all around nice/clear teacher! lectures a little dry sometimes but its microbio, its not all gonna be interesting", "Nadiya Fink is the worst!!! Her tests were extremely long and a lot of my friends received B- or C range grade during the midterm. Her lectures were filled with her calculations which only she can understand. No explanation at all!!! Don't take her class if your GPA matters.", "She explains everything clearly and gets through material very efficiently. She takes her time to go through a practice problem or two for every topic she teaches allowing students to be able to attempt homework problems on their own. She also holds regular office hours and is very helpful in answering any questions you have on the homework.", "Fink is not a good professor - she is very hard to not only understand but pay attention too. She doesn't phrase things in the best ways and sometimes doesn't handles questions well. Taking it with her, will make you work much harder for your grade. Also the exams are ridiculously hard with a C average sometimes.", "Nadiya Fink does not even deserve a chance to teach students. Especially at such a great university. She does not know how to care and help students. NO curves. NO explanation. Almost one-third of my classmates received a C range result in some exams. She failed a lot of students in her class. Don't take her class if your GPA matters.", "I wanted to give Dr. Fink a chance, but she honestly confused me so much. After doing just ok on the first exam, I stopped going to Fink's lectures and only went to Gunderson's. I scored four letter grades higher on exam 2. If you have Fink, I recommend watching lecture recordings or going to a different lecture. Also, use GSI office hours for HW.", "Stats 426 with Fink was the worst class that I have ever taken. She is a good lecturer, but she doesnt give adequate practice material, her exams are extremely difficult, and most importantly, her class is totally uncurved. Because of this, a good chunk of my class received in the C range and below. Avoid taking if you care about your GPA.", "This instructor is a good lecturer but gives ridiculous grade. Medium is C+ to B-, no curve at all. The most unfair issue is that other instructor(s) give much higher grades. Never take Stats 426 with her!!!", "To be honest, I've never seen such a horrible teacher before. Almost every one of my classmates was having a problem with the material she taught. She gave these hard, long exam which obviously was impossible to finish and she did not curve the grade. HORRIBLE!!!", "Absolutely the worst teacher I've had in all of college. The class is difficult, uncurved, and is extremely work heavy even though it is only supposed to be a 3 credit class. Additionally, her notes are hard to read. A good chunk of my class has a C and below and she still refuses to curve. I would avoid taking classes with her at all costs.", "The worst professor I've had in two years at Michigan. She does a bad job of explaining examples in class, homework takes 2-4 hours to complete weekly and the tests are impossible to finish in time, let alone being very hard. She doesn't curve either so almost half the class won't pass. I would never consider a course taught by Fink again. Ever.", "Try to get Gunderson or do not take Stats 250. Stats with Fink I think actually screwed up my thinking on different concepts in stats and wish I hadn't gone to any of her lectures. Seems like a nice lady but I get a headache trying to constantly understand her.", "Homework due every week with about 5-7 pages long, exam is the hardest and longest i have ever taken. The main point is no curve at all, even my class medium was a C. If you have another choice, don't pick her class.", "I almost got depression from this class. I did not do really well in the first exam, and I just see no hope in this class. Regardless of how hard and how people perform in this class. This class does not curve. Please if one day she can see those feedback, she would understand how her students feel about her grading.", "NO curve. I almost cried. Her exams were sooo long and she took off most of points in an exam question because of only missing minor things. The homework is due weekly and each of them took me around 10 pages of writing. Some of her exam material does not match her homework. If I can give a negative rating for her, I would.", "Worst teacher ever. Obviously, she does NOT know how to teach/explain and she does NOT curve the grade given the fact that her exam was long and heavy. One advice on how to learn stats: DON'T take Nadiya's class.", "Take stats w/ Gunderson, or at a diff school altogether. Fink does what she can, but she teaches poorly and lacks the concept side of stats that is needed to survive the painfully hard exams. It's unbelievable how much of a waste of time, work, and money this class is, for a widely prereq math class that makes you writes papers and buy hw access.", "Of the professors for STATS250, Fink is by far the worst. It came to the point where I had to attend both her and Gunderson's online lectures to understand the material, and then I stopped going to lecture altogether because it was actually hurting my understanding. If you get stuck with her, attend a different lecturer and you'll do much better.", "Nadiya FInk is a horrible teacher. Her teaching structure is very unorganized and her lecture is all about computing the problems. NO explanation. NO study guides. Her first exam has an average about C- and she does not curve at all. Straight scaled. Worst teacher I've ever had in my life.", "Professor Fink explains things extremely clearly and takes you through problems step-by-step. Easily one of the best I've had at Michigan.", "Her lecture is detail-oriented and well organized. And she is good at explaining concepts and computation step by step. I went to her office hours several times and it is really useful. Also I think the workload is okay since it's a 400 level course and there are too many things going on. You cannot learn anything without doing homework.", "She gives long, meaningless homework with repetitive calculations, but not enlightening exercises. She also likes to post half of hw online and updated it 3 days later which makes careless students(like me) forget to update hw. Don't ask her deep concepts, she doesn't know either. Her exam questions are organized in a weird way too.", "Insane amount of homework. You gotta spend more than 8 hours on homework.", "Take this class with her! She explains all concepts clearly and goes through every example problem step-by-step. She's also very helpful in office hours and is willing to help you through any problem. If you just go to class and pay attention you should be good.", "Dr. Fink's lectures for Math/Stats 425 were perfectly fine--nothing extraordinary, but she did a good job explaining all of the concepts and doing examples. With that being said, I personally found the content of the course very uninteresting and tedious.", "During my semester of stats 250, Dr. Fink moved much faster than Gunderson's class. I always felt like concepts were rushed and never fully understood. It got to the point where I went to Fink's lecture to get the clicker points but watched Gunderson's lectures later on. Take this course with Gunderson if you can.", "She was very nice, but the class is very memorization heavy. If you don't memorize the concluding sentences for each test prepare to lose a lot of points.", "Nadiya has trouble explaining concepts that should be easy to explain. She is also unwilling to admit when she is wrong (or even worse, doesn't understand why she's wrong!). If you like learning, don't take MATH 425 with her. You will hate statistics and life afterwards. The worst part is that she doesn't post completed notes.", "STATS250 is a piece of cake if you've taken basically any math or technical class on campus. Prof. Fink always helped me anytime I went to office hours, and did a great job moving through content at a good pace. Her accent wasn't a problem at all.", "Dr. Fink seems like she knows what she's talking about and I think she wanted us to do well, but she didn't really get that across in lectures. Exams are difficult, especially if you do not have a background in statistics. If you take this course, no matter the professor, make sure you review ALL concepts before exams. They will surprise you.", "An OK lecturer teaching an easy class.", "Lara is great IMO. 116 is definitely challenging if we do not spend enough time on it. She makes sure that you do enough practice inside and outside of the classroom to succeed. Plus, she is very enthusiastic about math and teaching and is always willing to help if you need it.", "Great GSI IMO. She gives very hard quizzes but is super enthusiastic about math, explains things in a clear manner and will always make time to meet outside of class :)!", "Her quizzes are difficult, but they will make the exams seem so much easier. Lara holds many extra office hours if you have questions and she is dedicated to helping each student learn. I would recommend this class f you don't mind the extra work in turn for a better understanding.", "Lara is tough, but if you make an effort to understand the material, she will work with you until you do. She went above and beyond for my class, scheduling extra office hours on weekends before exams and returning graded assignments promptly. Her quizzes are difficult, but you will be very well prepared for exams if you put in the work.", "I took math 116 in the spring. She has her strict rules in attendance and some principles, sometimes make dry jokes, yet she give really amazing lectures. Her content is logically organized and clearly conveyed to every students. If you ask her a question, she may come back later to ask you if you really understand the question.", "To the person who said that this teacher is awesome, you are deluding yourself. This teacher does not go over review problems and all examples given in class reflect quiz questions on a bare surface level.", "As someone who just took Lara's course, I can say she is far from the horrible person described. Yes, Calculus II is  hard, so she has to get you to practice so you can succeed. Please stop criticizing the teacher just because you hate the material. Objectively  speaking, Lara is patient, professional and caring for every student.", "She's not the most clear instructor I've had but she will help you if you ask.  Though sometimes when I've asked questions she has acted confused at to why I didn't understand it still which left me still confused sometimes.  She's not the worst option, but wouldn't really recommend her.", "If she's your teacher, run.  She's very unhelpful and was downright rude to me when I asked for help in office hours.  Avoid at all costs.", "Literally the worst teacher in the world. She grades so harshly without reason and looks at  you like you're dumb if you ask a question. ", "Amazingly she isn't the worst of the 370 lecturers, although that in itself says something about the course quality. She tries hard and is quite friendly, but her explanations are often quick, contradictory, and leave people confused. However, she does answer student questions and will reiterate concepts. Not the worst out there, but needs work.", "Reetu is alright, she isn't horrible and makes a solid effort at explaining the concepts. However her explanations of the in class examples leave much to be desired. They need to be done slower and with more explanation", "Pretty good. Nothing special but she explains clearly", "Not very clear during lecture, the course material was presented in a way that was confusing an contradicted itself. I was excited for the sole hardware class CS majors have to take at U of Michigan and I was let down.", "Prof Das lectured on the datapaths section of 370. She's good, but the class isn't that well-run. There was a lot of discontinuity in the instruction of 370 this semester,  but Prof. Das taught her portion fairly well. Nothing spectacular or particularly interesting, but not a bad class either.", "I thought that Carolyn always tried to motivate her classes to respect mathematics, and did so effectively. I liked all of her lectures. I think that the students who say she's not clear are just a bit daft: she makes small errors. She will talk to anyone, and she's very easy to make an appointment with.

Even though i didn't like it at the time.", "I just had Carolyn for Linear Algebra and I must say I think some of the comments on here are excessively harsh.

Any capable student shouldn't mind her.", "Useless", "learned about as much linear algebra reading these reviews as i did reading her notes. always late, writes too small on the board so 2/3 of the class cant read it without telescopes, makes far too many mistakes on the board, hasn't learned English despite teaching in an English university now, notes don't make sense and are full of mistakes. bad.", "i was genuinely considering buying the \u00c2\u00a360 poole book just so i didnt have to turn up to her last lecture", "...", "She's a nice person, probably a very clever lady, she just can't teach.", "Worst Prof I've had since I've been here.  She was late to almost every class and 45 minutes late to the final saying she was sick but the exams were still warm from the copier.  She really should not be a professor here.", "She got cookies and juice for our class one day. That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about her.", "Pathetic. I'd just be restating the other reviews if I write more.", "Do not take her as your professor.  She is awful.  There is nothing that I can say nice about her, besides she was alwasy late, and therefore allowed us to have plently of time before class to talk about how much we disliked her.", "Wow..., what a terrible professor.  She is constantly late to class and says \"I wasn't feeling well,\" \"I'm on my period.\"  She actually managed to show up to an exam 35 minutes late.  She should be fired.", "She lacks teaching skills. I didn't learn anything from her lecture. However, her course is easy to get A.", "She is a terrible lecturer. I am almost positive that at least half of the class is more competent at calculus than she is herself. She is constantly being corrected by students, and not on purpose either. I have really learned absolutely nothing from her.", "As said, she struggles with in-class examples, further confusing students.  She is very unprofessional.  I never even received a syllabus from her.  Probably about 45% of the time she came to class and said she was sick and wouldn't be able to lecture.  More than 5 mintues late to class every day.  Does provide many office hours and reviewsessions.", "Do math professors need to take an exam on the class their teaching?  I think I know more about linear algebra than Carolyn Dean after I read the sections in the book.  Here's a summary on Dean's abilities: If we ask questions in class, she cannot answer any hard questions and some basic ones and ask students what they did...", "she sucks. Avoid her. That way u will learn at least something.", "unorganized. Her knowledge is doubtful. She lacks teaching skills.", "Absolutly terrible at explaining something if you don't get it the first time.

Go to a different lecture if possible.", "she makes a lot of mistakes and doesn't know what she's doing", "I found Professor Becky extremely helpful, passionate, and overall a great teacher.

Super nice, a little bid odd, but great overall.", "If you have taken any coding class before, Engr 101 will be a breeze. You don't have to show up to the lectures, they are all online.

She does use the overhead and writes all her notes but it's not bad once you get the hang of it. Kind of a change of pace from the oh so popular reading the powerpoint slides. She posts all her lectures, with video, online which is helpful. Overall she knows her stuff and she is one of the better professors here.", "Dr. J was a good professor.  She puts all of the lectures online, so going to class isn't really mandatory.  She goes extremely fast and does everything on an overhead, so I recommend watching the videos of the lectures.

You NEED to go to class to do well", "Nice enough lady, but I had a rough time with her style of teaching Genetics. I felt like she talked a lot in circles, wasn't always clear, and lectures were disorganized. Exams were relatively tricky for me--despite feeling pretty confident having done the practice problems.

You should be fine for the exams if you understand the analysis behind all the experiments, and understand the homework assignments.", "There was a ridiculous amount of work--far too much for a lab.  I learned nothing in her class.  Her lectures were disorganized and the coursepack was terrible.  Also, very tough on grading.  I received the highest grade in my section (according to my GSI), but Dr. J would not curve it up to an A.  I hope she never teaches again.", "Very nice woman, but not such a great professor.  Her lectures are done with an overhead and extremely disorganized. No lecture slides posted.  Be prepared to put in up to 5 hrs in the lab outside of the required 3 hrs. Tests are impossibly hard and much harder than earlier assignments, examples, and \"practice\" tests.  Worst lab I've ever taken!", "Exams were fair and assignments were not unreasonable, but lecture was VERY disorganized and, while it made sense during class, was difficult to follow and make sense of weeks later while studying for exams.  Also, there were no review sessions and only two practice exams per semester, so it was hard for students to know what was expected of them.", "nice personality but difficult class. with all the additional hours spent in lab, students should be receiving higher grades", "She goes out of her way to make sure that you know the material and will do well in the class. All you have to do is ask and she will help. Critical but one of the best and most helpful professors that I have had.", "Knew her material very well, yet she her teaching method was out-dated at best. Only used overhead projector (did not post lectures on ctools). Tests were quite difficult & she hardly curved the class even though the average was barely a c+. Overall she is smart but kind of a prick when it comes to grades.", "Nice Teacher, Hard Tests", "By far my fav class at UM. I highly recommend it. She's a very funny prof and I enjoyed her lectures (she only uses overhead to teach). 2exams, 1paper, 1poster, notebook eval, participation. Where else do you get to observe frog&chick embryo development and do experiments on them? You have to be comfortable with live animal experiments though..", "Very clear. Knows her subject very well.", "Nice woman but lectures are mediocre.  She uses an overhead to teach rather than powerpoint which proves to be a disadvantage to students.  Tests are easy but tricky.", "Forces you to be a good note-taker because she doesn't post anything but lecture outlines on CTools.  She has a very good sense of humor and is very friendly.  Discussion sections weren't mandatory, as there were no quizzes, but it was worth going in order to get help on problems that weren't clearly understood.", "Dr. Jeyabalan's a good professor overall. Good speaker, helpful, etc. However, she doesn't post lectures/diagrams on ctools. She writes all notes on transparencies with a thick marker, so it can be difficult to read. Drawing diagrams she draws before class makes taking notes in her lectures a drag. Tests were fair but challenging. P/F recommended.", "such a sweet lady.  she is friendly and clear with an unexpected sense of humor.  she seems very concerned with the students' understanding of the material.  she tells you exactly what is and what is not important to learn.", "Good teacher, and tests are a lot easier than the other professors'.", "No Comments", "Robin is one of the nicest lecturers I've ever had (also flexible w/ meeting outside of class). Grading was ok-ish but she extensively comments on your work on Canvas. The class is basically a writing class that writes your ROV. There were a couple of heavy papers, but just have her review it before you submit & you'll be fine.", "Robin really knows her stuff. Ask her to go through your reports with you so you can hear what she wants. Be aware that your grade is more dependent on tech comm than design, build, test. This means that you can make an ROV that fails and still do well in the class, but if you don't take the time to write great reports then you may not get an A.", "Takes off a lot of points for dumb things, especially with it being one of the hardest ENGR 100 sections", "Robin is a great technical communication professor. Although she can be nitpicky, she does not take off that many points for things she finds and she is always there to discuss her grading. ", "Robin is the nicest professor ever. She really cares about her students and wants you to have success. I had her for Engineering 100 last year and now am a peer mentor for the class. She and Dr. Young were both great. I'd take another class from her in a heart beat.", "This has got to be the hardest class of the Engr 100 sections. I think the previous years, everyone was getting an A and they decided to beef up the course material. The class average was a 75.", "Really helpful instructor, but you have to ask for it. Lots of feedback and very clear.", "She is THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!! does everything to ensure students learn as much as possible without making it too stressful. i wish all professors were like her", "ROBIN IS THE BEST. i love her. I would hang out with her, she is such a great person and seriously smart. she is not an engineer, which is honestly a nice change. she helped me so much, and really was a fantastic teacher. pretty easy too.", "Robin is so freaking awesome. She is so nice and helpful. She has a good sense of humor and makes you feel good about yourself and your work (rare in the college of engineering).", "very cute teaching style. Exams and homework mainly on things directly done in class, but it does make you think. The class itself isn't that hard, but she makes it really enjoyable", "Kang is awesome, favorite professor so far at umich, get to know her by going to office hours and she will be very helpful.", "Good Professor. Her lectures were clear and she presented the material with enthusiasm. I had no problems understanding her. The homework was challenging, but the exams were reasonable -- most of the problems came from the lectures and homework.", "Prof. Kang knows her stuff. She uses the entire class period every day and moves a little fast but she is a good teacher and is willing to work with you anytime. She runs a good class and does her best to help you.", "claims that she will grade you based on if she \"thinks you understand\", which is pretty subjective and vague. hard to understand at first. some topics were ones that i was just at a loss for understanding. not much help. not many office hours. very enthusiastic, though", "Kang enjoys her subject and has fun teaching, although she is probably not the best teacher on campus. Lots of homework. She will go out of her way to help students who need help. Tests are very difficult (median of about 60%, and she claims there's no curving), but definitely fair.  Would recommend, but be prepared to work hard.", "I cannot stand her class. No one does well on her tests, her voice annoys the snot outta me. She thinks cell phones are the devil and it is difficult to follow in her lectures", "nice professor,but not providing a lot office hr.  all the exam problems were from examples from the book and homework.", "Ridiculous. Can barely understand a word she's saying. Answers questions with either a huge smile or \"see me after crass\". No laptops allowed. SO BORING!!!!!", "This prof is great.  It does take a week or two to get used to her sytle and accent, but once you do, she's quite entertaining and knowledgeable :) She does sometimes get carried away with really pedantic derivations...", "Very helpful. Easy exams. Most of the questions in exams are from the examples discussed in class.", "At first I was really scared.  She has a really thick accent.  But after a week you get used to it.  She's incredible one on one, so if you don't understand something go to office hours.  Office hours are the key to this class.  Tests are fairly difficult but straightforward.", "No Comments", "It's kinda hard to understand her at first. You get used to it after the first week or so. She has a really strange sense of humor, but it's funny once you get it. And there's a crapload of work. But such is diffeq. She's extremely helpful and a really good teacher in her office hours, so that rules.", "I actually really liked her as a professor. I didn't have any troubles understanding her. I thought the exams were somewhat difficult, but I felt that she really cared about her students and how well they did. It was nice to see a math professor who would talk with students and who seemed \"normal\"", "Hard to understand in lecture, very helpful in office hours, fair grading scale, Overall, i learned a lot and did well in the class.", "exams are tough, does not prepare you well for exam. hard to understand in class.  Do fine in other classes, but not hers.", "Horrible. Speeds through topics, doesn't explain subjects well. I can handle the material in my other (mech. eng.) classes easily, but understanding her way of teaching is impossible. However, she is very smart, and also relatively nice (on a personal level).", "Terrible. Explains things poorly, writes over difficult exams and does not give partial credit. If you care about your gpa, take a different prof.", "Worst professor I have ever had.  I would rather eat dog**** than take her class again.  She thinks you are only taking her class and her explanation for any problems that students have understanding is that you arent spending enough time on it.  Sorry, but not all of us are human calculators.", "No Comments", "(bang,bang)\"is this on?\" (referring to her mic)\"..hmmm, lets see, first you write the differential etation ummhmmm. Now, u know this, ahhhh lets see...first person, second line..what is the answer..hmm u don't know, then lets see, second person, second line..\"umhmmmm\" - 3 hours a week of \"ummhmmm.\"", "God-awful.  Looking around the room was somewhat encouraging, as everybody else's incredulous and angry faces made me feel at least average.  She speaks with a heavy accent, writes terribly, and explains the concepts as well as would a cinder block.", "Some portions of this class are easier than others. IF you have a good prof., the class can be easy. Her tests were hard, and she did not explain things very well, she expects you to know Out of 100 people, 7 got A's., 5 B's, the rest C's or lower....", "While the class itself is easy, she is a terrible teacher.  Many people in my class dropped because she was so bad at explaining anything.  She also taught the examples from the book, so class was often a waste of time.", "She doesn't really clarify the usefulness or real world affects of the mathematics, she just proves the theorems and moves on. The fact that she is very quiet is also very frusturating. It takes a significant amount of effort to parse what she is saying. She takes good notes but does not post them for no discernible reason.", "Calc 1 isn't the best as a lot of the beginning math classes have a pretty bad rep that stays true to reality; however, Ruowen was a really good instructor that was caring, clear in her lectures, didn't dish out hard quizzes and always prepared for questions. Definitely would recommend her!", "One of the better Calc 1 professors. She was very understanding of students' concerns and prepared us well for the exams. Not much variation between Calc 1 sections but Ruowen was a very good instructor.", "This class has multiple lecturers, and Maria was probably the best. Her slides are clear and her exam questions are straightforward. Make sure you go to lecture though, since they aren't recorded and they'll talk about stuff that isn't always on slides but shows up on the exams. Exams are also all multiple choice so very little room for error.", "Dr. Sandkvist was a great lecturer. Her lectures were easy to understand. Her exam questions were pretty straightforward for the most part, but the other professors' questions were trickier. This is one of those classes that is split into multiple instructors.", "Very nice, helpful, willing to answer all questions. A bit of an accent, but not a problem understanding her. Exam questions easy.", "Prof. Lavieri was absolutely fantastic. Clearly gave a lot of thought into how to best communicate a topic to students. She puts up notes that you fill out as she lectures, and they are super helpful. One of my favorite professors at Michigan.", "Her lectures were extremely unclear, long, and boring. She tried to get participation from students but did not really know how to engage the class. Homework did not relate very well to lectures and was very difficult. Exams did not relate very well to practice exams or homework. Overall not a great class, I would avoid if possible.", "Professor Lavieri gives you the annotated notes if you can't make it to class, however it is recommended you go to class because she explains the concepts further in lecture. The material can be difficult, but it is manageable. The GSI office hours helped tremendously with success in this course. ", "Class is pretty easy. Exams are pretty easy with maybe 1 or 2 curveballs. She allows you to bring a notesheet into the exam but you're not allowed to put examples on it and she collects it with your exam.", "Professor Lavieri is a good teacher overall.  She is easy to understand and legitimately cares about her students. She was more than willing to help when I didn't understand something on an assignment.  However, her last exam was very difficult.", "Crazy about honor code.", "Great instructor. Open to suggestion. A little hard to get A", "She is a great teacher. She always makes the idea clearly. The lab material and homework help to understand the concept.", "Spends to much time on the easy stuff. The second test is brutal and unforgiving. Luckily, for most of you the first test will pad your grade a little.Doesn't curve the class, even if the averages are low. Her exams are written to deliberately trick students and then claims  the exams are \"straight forward.\" Also, crazy about the honor code...", "Class started off easy but quickly became more challenging.  Spends more time on easy problems than hard ones", "Barb is very sweet and I love her as a person. She is very passionate about teaching, but the class feels like a zoo at times with how unorganized it is. The GSIs mostly run the show, but it seemed like there wasn't much communication between the whole instruction team. Class is an easy A (if you at least try), and there's TONS of extra credit.", "I wish all of my coding instructors had been as great as professor Ericson. She is able to break down confusing concepts so students can understand it, slides are very clear, concise, and easy to follow. So long as you attended all the lectures, did every assignment and went to office hours there is no reason you won't get an A.", "Very nice, keeps lectures interesting, doesn't surprise with unexpected material on exams/projects. We had 10 homeworks, 2 projects and 1 midterm. iClicker in lecture. Very good at explaining concepts. Sometimes unclear about criteria and requirements. Really not hard to get an A if you do the assignments and pay attention.", "Funny and enthusiastic, Tatiana genuinely loves math and loves teaching. She's extremely helpful and runs the class such that it emphasizes understanding rather than just grades. My favorite teacher so far at U of M.", "Its too bad she is leaving Michigan. She is a gifted teacher who truly loves her subject.", "Prof Tatiana is an extremely fun teacher. She takes great care in ensuring that the exam questions are manageable. You can't screw up this class. :)", "Tatiana found a way to make Honors Calc 3 FUN! I believe I laughed at least once every lecture. She did a great job teaching the material and was very helpful during her office hours. The best part was how easy the exams were. She gave the easiest type of problems of each topic covered to just test that you know everything. Highly recommend!", "Prof Howard won't be teaching at UM next year but she's a great teacher despite her accent because she encourages student involvement in class (if anything the accent makes class better). If you participate in class, you won't fall asleep, and YOU'LL LEARN. Homework load is decent, and the midterms were way easier than MATH 215. But the final...", "Tatiana gives nice points through homework.  Her class was a bit too many proofs, but as long as one does the homework and keeps up, they won't see any real problems.  Tough subject material though...", "Very interested in her job, very fun, gets class excited about math. She is great at making herself available to help out if you need it. Her office hours are amazing!", "Tatiana is awesome.", "Prof. Howard is a pretty good prof. Goes over the matterial with you but you do have to go read the sections for yourself if you want to do well.", "She is a fantastic professor who really enjoys the material.  She expects a lot but gives a lot in return.  Expect about two quizzes a week, but they are all extremely doable if you pay attention.", "To those who said she is bad:you really dont understand her at all. you dont know how happy she is when the median of the quiz is 10, and she really expects you to succeed. yes she is hard, but you learn more in her class. you are expected to study 1 hour after each class, and that is what she asks you to do. Want easy class? Take 215.", "Worse math professor I have ever had. Period. She barely knows her stuff, teaches in the most convoluted manner possible, and is so rude to her students that I know people who cried after class.  No office hours. HW took math majors hours! Tests are impossible. There is no curve and the material is not on the test. Hardest section.  Others easier.", "I found her hard but very helpful. She really cares about student success. She is available alot outside of office hours and returns email almost hourly. She assumes you know more than you know so her lectures are sometimes hard to follow and her tests are hard. I love that she cares about her subject.", "She is a good teacher, her course is challenging. Sure it may hard since it's a honor course. If you want to take easy course, it may not be a good choice, but if you want to love math just take it. Now I'm planing on my math major.", "She certainly cares about her students, and she works through things pretty well in class.  However, most of what she does in class is in the textbook word-for-word.  I can't she is a good teacher, but she is not bad either.", "Usless instructor. On her best day she barely knew what she was talking about and on her worse it was unbearable. Her tests were impossible and her homework equally as bad. There was no curve. Her section was way harder than the others. She rarely showed up toher office hours and was very rude to students. Called them stupid. Avoid her at all costs", "Her accent did get a little annoying at times. One word in particular that bothered me was her pronunciation of the words 'matrix' and 'matrices,' which we heard like 100 times per lecture. Other than that though she was very helpful and I learned a lot from her class.", "I took two of her classes (MATH 216 & 217) in the past two semesters. She knows the materials very, very well and is ready to clarify any doubt from students. In 217, she explained the materials clearly; it's just that the exams weren't as simple as homework and class examples.", "She was nice but her accent got really annoying. The lecture was very clear but very boring and systematic.", "I rarely attended lecture and usually just taught myself from the book, but she is extremely helpful in office hours and answered any questions I emailed her.", "Tatyana is an awesome professor. She is nice, cute, adorable; but at the same time- she knows math. Teaches in a nice way- very organized. Loved her class! This class is an easy one- and if you have someone like Tatyana as your professor, it becomes even easier.", "She's very knowledgeable but I find the lack of class participation inhibiting.  She doesn't make it very interesting, but one on one she's very helpful.", "She was a very good professor - one of the few good math professors at UM. She goes over everything that she might test, and also makes time to go through several examples. Very prompt with emails, and helpful in office hours. Exams are very reasonable and homework is very useful and do-able. You'll get an A if you keep up with work.", "Professors like her make UM worth it. Tatyana made linear algebra fun and easy to understand. I also had her for Math 216. She's great!", "A wonderful professor, one of the most helpful I've encountered so far. Explains everything thoroughly and does at least one example for every concept. Go to office hours if you need any help at all. She went above and beyond to help me when I was struggling with the class after switching into it late in the semester. You won't regret taking her!", "One of the best math professor that I've ever had in UM.Linear algebra ain't easy,but she makes the materials so comprehensible that this course seems easier than any other calculus classes.willing to help students to score well in their exams.", "Explained all of the material very thoroughly; would do an example for every concept so it was very easy to understand. Overall one of the best math teachers i've had at UofM.", "A tad quiet, but teaches/goes over absolutely every single thing that is then covered on exams, which makes the class that much easier provided you do the hw.  If you email her, she will respond promptly and is very helpful there as well.  Overall, very good professor and a pretty easy class.", "Tatyana is very organized and clear. When someone asks a stupid question, she may seem to give a condescending look but really she is just trying to figure out how she would explain the simple concept to a monkey.    Her english is excellent and she grades very fair.  She is extremely helpful in office hours and I wish I would have gone more.", "She was a pretty chill tech comm professor. I'm definitely going to try to get into her section the next time I have to take a tech comm class!", "She teaches in an understandable, good pace. She may or might not know answers to a question right away and likes to get student's feedback/thoughts on questions before giving her own perspective. I liked her teaching style and stayed relatively awake through this semester", "EECS 351 was one of the easiest EECS classes I've taken, but I didn't feel like I learned a lot of new stuff. Prof. Diaz was pretty good, but she wasn't particularly inspirational or helpful when it came to making us understand the math we blindly go through in homework and tests.", "She is the prime example of a Michigan professor, who is there to do research and is obviously forced to teach. What a terrible decision to let her teach an introductory course!   I know you went to MIT for your PhD, Dr. Arruda, but do not forget your humble beginnings in undergrad at Penn State.", "Ellen Arruda was the worst professor I had at the University of Michigan. She was condescending, if you didn't understand specific material, and presented her material poorly. On exams, students in her section failed on average, whereas students in other sections did well.", "At first, she seems like an ordinary teacher who teaches concepts first and then does practice problems.  The very first homework is so easy you would think this class is a joke. But as the weeks pass by, you suddenly realize she isn't making any sense, homeworks are getting tougher and the midterms just blew your mind.", "difficult class but exams are actually very straighforward. if you understand how things are derived and what they really mean, you'll ace the class. almost every exam problem comes form something she does in class, so redo class problems before the exam and you'll be set.", "She doesn't prepare you for her exams. She tells you the hw won't help, but that is the only time we actually work with the material other than in class. She doesn't give you a practice exam so you don't know what to expect.", "Personally I feel like those professors who provide print-outs and explain the key points in lectures. She's the opposite type, putting down her own notes with occasional mistakes and occasional explanations. It's a mechanics course but like a math course without explanation. Very good terminology and mild grading policy. Really confusing notations", "The average for our second midterm was about a 30% so she dropped it and we took 4 quizzes that were averaged and we did not get to learn beam deflections. She is obsessed with strain gauges.", "Her lectures were unclear and in many cases I just sat there lost and then looked at the \"optional\" textbook later.  The homework took me a long time, but that might be because I found the lecture notes useless.  It is possible that if you can stand this type of material you might find her class more reasonable than I did.  Then again, maybe not.", "I thought she was a good teacher, she got to the point.  As long as I paid attention in lecture there was no need for a textbook.  The homework was not entirely consistent with her lectures because it is common to all the 211 sections, and not made by her.  Her tests were interesting (hard), but curved, and she was concerned with their fairness.", "Avoid.

Expect to do most of your learning from the internet and \"not mandatory\" textbook.", "It sure was a difficult class, but if you really pay attention to the professor you should be able to understand the materials. She explains everythng very thoroughly and make good examples. A lot of the exam problems actually came from her examples.", "This is a very difficult course no matter who you take it from. Her lectures were pretty boring and she doesn't use her own lecture material, luckily the lecture slides are posted online. The exams are extremely difficult!", "Very hard exams that are difficult to prepare for as more often than not the reviews and homeworks are nothing like the exam questions. Take the class with Thouless instead", "AWFUL teacher - made an easy subject very difficult. Her exams were IMPOSSIBLE. Our section typically scored 20-30% below the other sections. Not helpful, very condescending. She didn't do helpful example problems in class - avoid, avoid, avoid.", "Terrible professor in every aspect, gives extremely hard exams and does not prepare you for them.", "Please try to avoid her. HWs are hard and exams very hard. They have been the worst i have ever given. She does not prepare her own slides which make things worst.", "One of the worst professors I've had here. As stated, rude to students. Her lectures barely cover what you need to know(teaches only the most general gist of what you need to know, making it extremely hard to complete hw). Expect to buy the \"not madatory\" textbook and read that instead. No need to go to her lecture.", "She is horrible at explaining concepts to the class. You really have to rely on the Gsi 100%. This is only worsens when she dosent use any examples in the class. My advice is to not get her as a teacher for anything. She is quite rude to her students and lacks respect.", "Great professor. Very efficient in lecture. There were times she finished three lectures worth of material in one class period. Great at explanations. Not as bad as everybody else is saying she is... She's very knowledgeable passionate in this field and her rating should reflect this. Great professor overall.", "I know people like her because she's very college age friendly, and she's pretty famous. But, the class is THE WORST class i've ever had at Michigan.(I graduated) The exams are unfair, material is all over the place, you got a GSI trying to explain material science in terms of pancakes, the class is just so random, and the test as well.", "This class was one of the most unfair that I have come across, they gave the same midterms to both sections, which definetly had an effect on the later section. in addition, both midterms were unfair, the first covered irrelevant material, and the second was too long. BTW the material has no relevance, all memorization.", "Generally a good teacher.  Just make sure that you have the lecture notes printed out before class and that you do the examples in class.  Better than Prof. Jones, in my opinion.", "No Comments", "Great Prof, very helpful, no supermodel, but easy on the eyes", "Intro Oceanography is not the easy NS course you are looking for - lots of time required for end of week quizzes, HW, and studying for exams if you are looking for an A.

Only take if necessary/if interested", "She goes through her lectures quickly and gives weekly quizzes but all of the answers are in the powerpoints (which she posts on canvas). Very sweet but requires a lot of work for an introductory class. Thought this was going to be an easy NS credit but I wound up having to study a fair amount. Very nice person but not the class I was looking for.", "Professor Petersen is a good person and cares about her teaching style. However, the way she tests her students is HORRIBLE. Her exams are probably some of the worst formatted tests I've ever had to take. For an introductory course, this class is horrible, especially if you are taking this for a QR2 Math Credit. Take an Astro Course instead.", "Actually the worst professor I've ever had at University of Michigan. She goes extremely fast and doesn't do a good job of explaining concepts and then tests you right away. There's weekly quizzes that ask way more in depth than anything we learned in class and there's no textbook. If you're not an oceanography expert do not take this class.", "Super unaccommodating for those with illnesses etc. Told me it was policy to email before class to get illness related absences excused. When I told her I was physically unable to email her any earlier, she never responded. Did the same when I was admitted to the ER.", "Her tests are worth 45% of the grade but offers no extra credit. Her advice? Earn every non-exam point as possible. She talks very quickly through lecture and expects us all to just \"get it'\". VERY clicker heavy, but at least it bumps up your grade a tiny, minuscule amount. She should just be allowed to research. She is not equipped to teach.", "Holly is an AWESOME GSI. She takes difficult material and explains it in a way that makes sense. She is also very helpful in office hours and truly wants her students to do well in the course.", "Literally one of the best GSI's at the University of Michigan. She breaks the most complex concepts down into language everyone can understand. I got through Calc III largely due to Holly's help in lab and office hours", "Complete sweetheart. Very clear and  excellent teacher. Really wants students to do well", "One of the few professors who worked to learn the name of every single student in our lecture. Class lectures are very organic, since there is a back-and-forth between her and the students about the material. Students are highly encouraged to ask questions, and she created a really warm and welcoming learning atmosphere.", "Professor Cohn is incredible. She is very helpful and a very good lecturer. However keep in mind that she is a tough professor in terms of grading and test but with her it is undoubtable that you will learn the material great and in great depth.", "One of the best at the IOE department, truly up to date in knowledge, and a great teacher. She captures your attention the whole lecture.", "I took Prof Cohn for IOE 310 in the fall of 2014.  She is a great teacher and provides you with everything you will need to succeed.  Would take her again in a heartbeat.", "Professor Cohn cares so much about having her students understanding the concepts. If you pay attention in lectures and actually try to learn the material you will do fine in the course. She's the best professor I've had so far. If given the opportunity, definitely take this course with her!", "Best professor at U of M. Knows her stuff better than anyone. You won't be disappointed.", "You won't get a better professor at this university.  The students below probably didn't do their work and bombed the first midterm.

But there are too much meaningless  repetition and unwarranted assumptions in the exam and problem  sets. ", "worst professor ever, have no idea what she is talking about, total chaos, the first half semester, basically repeat ioe 202 again, spend 10 lectures just to practice linear programming again and again. students may love her just because she is passionate and could tell some jokes, but for those who really don't want to waste your time, avoid her!", "While some professors are monotone and show an obvious indifference towards teaching, Professor Cohn is exactly the opposite. She cares about her students and it is blatantly obvious that she loves the material. The coursework can be difficult, but she presents it in a clear and engaging fashion.  She is hands down the best professor I have had.", "Definitely the best professor I've had at UM.  I'm not sure if it's what she normally does, but she curved the Fall 2013 section to around a B+ average.  Exams could be lengthy (I didn't finish the 2nd one and a lot of kids didn't finish any of them), but I always felt prepared from Professor Cohn's lectures, examples, and homework.", "Great Professor", "Best, and nicest, teacher at the entire university", "By far the best teacher I had at UM, advise you to wait to the Fall to take 310 so you have the opportunity to take it with her.", "Great teacher.", "Homeworks can be tedious sometimes, and there's a group project that painstakingly requires you to use AMPL, but other than that it was a very fair and interesting class.

If you have problems she tries her best to help.  Great at teaching and entertaining lectures.", "There is no book for this class, she just teaches-and she is amazing. She takes the time to thoroughly explain each concept. She even has weekly homework help sessions. Best teacher I've had at UM!!", "Great teacher, Makes material understandable and is always willing to help.", "Ridiculously hard class, prof Tucker is really nice but the workload is insane. Quiz every week where you have to memorize 25 Genus/species names and be able to identify them from just a skull. 80% look nearly identical so it takes hours. The final is 200 species that you have to memorize. Hardest final i have ever had at Michigan.", "I expected this class to be a really easy A, but the exams were pretty difficult because you literally have to memorize every detail from all the note slides for the short answer section; she gives you the essay questions beforehand, which was good. Very boring class; did not enjoy her lectures and hated the style of the exams.", "It's so hard to stay awake in her class.", "Class is easy. Lectures are boring ( and mandatory). I recommend doing the crossword from the Daily. She is very nice. The discussions are pointless and mandatory. Only take this class if you need it for your major. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. There, I just saved you $75.", "I'll agree that the lectures could have been more interesting but she's extremely helpful if you go to office hours. My biggest qualm was that a lot of material that's covered in lecture isn't on the exam; only the 7 biggest topics are tested, which you know ahead of time, but it made me less motivated to go to lecture. Overall it's a decent class.", "Though the class topic was interesting, she made the lectures very boring and ordinary.  It was hard to stay awake most of the time.", "The class is easy (she gives you exam questions ahead of time), but her lectures are really boring.  Make sure to pair up with other responsible people in the class in order to share possible answers for the exam (it's all essays and definitions).", "Even though Calc 1 is a very bad department, and it's hard to get A's, Dr. Lin is a very solid professor. Clear lectures and many examples in class help. She is often available for office hours.", "Very clear in lectures, sometime would use a powerpoint though which made it harder to pay attention. She did a very good job teaching the material and preparing for exams. Not amazing at answering questions but she was clear enough where I rarely had to", "Prof. Lin explains concepts very clearly. Her class is very fast-paced with tons of examples which is crucial to understanding the material. She is always eager to help.", "She's one of the best math teachers here, but that's not saying much. I stopped going to lecture about a quarter way through the semester.", "Math 215 is a very difficult class, but she tries her best to cover all the material very well. She is clear, but you haveto read the textbook before coming to class or you'll fall behind.", "Awesome professor for Calc III. She is very clear and makes sure everyone understands before continuing. She is always happy to answer questions during or after class too. Exams are tough, but those are the same for all professors.", "Great professor. Explains everything clearly and spends a lot of time doing example problems. She'll make sure everyone understands the material before moving on. Definitely would recommend for calc 3", "Can't put into words how good she was. Literally best calc 3 prof. in all of Umich. She has the best lectures and is probably the only one that is also understandable in terms of English. Students from other classes will come to her lecture. She will help you if you ask and is super helpful. Sends out extra ppt slides and other helpful resources. ", "Professor Lin is literally the best Calc 3 professor there is here.

She's very passionate about math and makes somewhat boring material interesting.", "Great teacher!", "Professor Lin really knows what she's talking about and you can tell she cares about giving her students all the opportunities for learning the material as she can. I have had no problems with her.", "Professor Lin is a dedicated teacher, her office hour always made me understand better about the material. However I really don't like the lab classes since they are boring and unuseful,  group works do not help me learn better in this class.", "I found Professor Lin's lectures pretty easy to follow, although she moves very quickly through material- so come ready to write.  The only thing she could work on would be that her lectures sometimes run a few minutes past the hour.  The class has webwork, written hw, a lab section, and exams.  Also, her English is not hard to understand.", "She often runs out of time and has to rush through the material, but her lectures are  pretty good. She goes over examples and makes sure everyone understands before moving on.", "Prof. Lin is enthusiastic and tries hard to teach. I respect her effort. I have never attended her office hours, but people who went said that she was very nice and helpful. English is not her first language, so I always had to be super focused in order to process her explanation.", "Constant irritation of web-work and several websites for assignments. The lab is not helpful either.", "Super unorganized, doesn't care about students, doesn't even know how to do math and is just stupid. She forgot to print out exams for our midterm then was confused about why we were all upset she expected us to finish the full exam in half the time. Most of what you learn is weirdly specific and will never help you again, even in statistics.", "Utterly incompetent. The class isn't that hard if you've taken stats before but she overcomplicates everything. Lectures are boring but they include specific details that she won't put in the notes or anywhere else so don't skip too much.

I am steering clear of her in the future.", "Took 280 2018 Fall Semester. This was her first class as a prof, so I guess I can cut her some slack. I took AP stats the year before, and like 80% of what I learned carried over. 1 HW set a week, not rly too much work load. If you've taken AP stats before, just look at lecture notes, and it should be an easy A.", "Went into this class excited about taking stats, if I ever see one more of her questions again in my life it will be too soon.

She's mean 2 students & looks 10 beware", "I took STATS280 in my 1st year at UMich, Fall 2018, and this class was the BANE of my existence. The lectures are all over the place--she goes through hard parts way too fast and many students are left confused about what they're confused about. Quizzes and exams are insane, each question is worth way too many points. 1 wrong and your grade dies.", "Snigdha knows her stuff but sometimes has a hard time communicating it at an appropriate level. There may be some language barrier issues. The ideas are rather abstract--tough for those familiar with the more concrete AP stats curriculum. The class is scaled nicely, a quiz and HW dropped, and exams (not quizzes) are straightforward. Easy A.", "Your academic success does not rest on your professor, it's a tripod: your attendance, taking good lecture notes, completing homework/studying... If there are gaps you're an academic... Research it and bring it to her for clarification- office hours or in class. It's you're education. Her job is exposure and a great resource. Stop complaining.", "Classes made me disillusioned. Does not give the impression that she is qualified to be teaching this class or deserves to be a professor at this school. On good days will stumble through a theorem or two (in an hour and a half lecture), on bad days has an unfriendly attitude when answering students questions. Definitely avoid.", "I don't think she prepare the class well. A lot of proofs she just stopped in the middle. And I learn nothing through her lecture.", "Pretty enthusiastic (especially for 8am). Lectures were pretty clear, although I used the textbook a decent amount. It's pretty good. The class was really interesting but moved pretty slowly. Homeworks were not easy, but really well designed and fun (kinda).", "I thought she did a really good job with 571.  Her lectures were really clear and the homework was pretty straightforward.  She was also always happy to meet with people outside of class.  The only problems was that I wasn't sure how to study for the second midterm since the concepts were kind of nebulous. But she was really generous grading it.", "This class was ridiculous. Her lectures were okay, but she never made extra effort to help students learn the material. The homework was incredibly difficult compared to lectures and the quizzes were poorly anounced and written.", "this is teacher was not great", "The teaching was not systematic at all. Classes cover really easy materials but homeworks are difficult and very time-consuming.", "The most evil professor that has ever taught.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Her lectures are engaging and informative. She has a great attitude in class and is very approachable. One of my favorite professors at UMich!", "Really loved taking Prof. Wooldridge's class. Lectures were recorded, homeworks and exams were straightforward. The class isn't curved like most engineering classes, but it doesn't need to be. She is very kind and has a good knowledge of each topic.", "Professor Wooldridge is fantastic. Not only is she a great professor but she will talk to you about almost anything and is very helpful in her office hours.

Professor Woolridge is genuinely interested in the subject material of every lecture and goes above and beyond. A+.

She made everything super easy to understand. ", "Prof. Wooldridge is awesome.  She really cares about the students and wants everyone to succeed.  Gives completely reasonable homeworks that relate directly to exam problems. Does get a little flustered at times.", "Amazing! Best professor I've had here.", "Absolutely fantastic. Super helpful, easy if you work for it.  Always willing to meet with you and help you. She is really intelligent and is always excited to teach thermo.  Excellent professor, would recommend 10/10! Also, she is super fun and pretty so that helps staying awake during lectures! Must take her for thermo!", "This was my second class taken taught by her. Worked hard to get myself off the waitlist and into the class. She is very enthusiastic about the subject (and thermo and heat transfer). She is makes things interesting and is easy to listen to.", "The professor is awesome!  She always answers questions and is extremely helpful during office hours.  She will go out of her way to try and help the students.  Very clear during lecture and gives good examples.", "Very good teacher,  indicated what you will need to know for the exam and what is just for homework.

I agree that she talked a bit too fast, but posted lecture notes helped me catch up what I missed in lectures. She was friendly to talk to too. Exams were a little easier than past semesters. Grading and regrading were fair. She dressed as an elf(?) for Halloween last year.", "Sometimes she went through topics too quickly and was unclear, probably because it was her first year teaching. I think she will get better as she goes.", "A lot of people were hard on her, but I think she was a pretty good teacher for her first time. She's actually nice to talk to if you make an effort when you go to her office hours. I think that she will get better as she learns more about teaching.", "She is the best of all time. Teaches great, do not assign a lot of homeworks. But in the end you learn a lot, in a very tough course. Not only this, she is also one of the nicest human beings.", "Ann Jeffers is the GOAT. one of the best professors in the CEE department. the exams are exactly like the homework, which are exactly like the lectures. easy A as long as you show up to class and pay attention. i dont know how she makes the class so easy but you still learn so much. i wish i had her for every class", "Ann was great! This course was easy, but she covered everything the course was supposed to, I understood everything, and when we did have questions, she was good at explaining concepts, and you can tell she really wants you to understand the material. There's a participation grade so attendance counts but its worth 5% of your grade which isn't bad.", "She's very nice and very good at teaching. She's not the most engaging at first, but once you get to know her she's so nice and even funny at times. I learned a lot from her class and her tests aren't too hard.", "She is an arrogant woman who does not know how to teach. She has many grammar and spelling mistakes on her assignments, which shows that she does not take her job seriously. Do not take her class if you want to keep your GPA from sinking like the Titanic.", "Horrible professor. She should not be allowed to teach. Avoid!", "Clearly did not understand how people learn, or that none of her students were math majors . Lectures rapidly covered complex subjects without good explanations, homework was long, frequent, and not covered in lecture, and before the exam you realize you still haven't learned anything. Luckily, exams were based on review packet with a decent curve.", "Excellent professor. Was never unreasonable about work assigned, and made it very clear what was expected of us. I found it most impressive that no matter how dumb the question, unless it was obvious the person didn't prepare properly, she was more than happy to stop and explain as long as needed. Just about as good as it gets for math professors", "She tries to make TC as fun as she can and is pretty funny for someone's who's so much older. But the material is incredibly dry and difficult to score well on, however, she really does drill you into a better communicator if you're willing to work. I hope you get a good group to work with.", "Fairly boring teacher, and a quiet one at that. Can't say too much, since I was asleep for a large portion of her lectures. But does give great feedback and is bound to improve your professional writing skills.", "Technical Communication is bound to be boring no matter who teaches it.  Dr. Hildinger tries to be entertaining, and she gives out candy to make lectures/discussion slightly more bearable.  She's a really tough grader but will give you tons of constructive comments to make you a better writer.  The group project for this section is a TON of work.", "Material can be a bit dry, but she is very knowledgeable and teaches very well.", "Professor Hildinger cares a lot about her students. She provides thorough responses on all assignments and is willing to meet outside of class to discuss assignments, even right before they're due. She is an incredibly tough grader, but this is because she really wants everyone to improve. In all, Professor Hildinger is a wonderful person.", "Dr. Hildinger is the grandmother everybody wants. She's sweet and kind, and even gives candy if you answer her questions correctly! She does a good job of communicating what she expects from technical communications, and gives excellent feedback on assignments. She is also very willing to give feedback for projects days before they're turned in.", "She's fairly clear on what you need to do for writing assignments, but sometimes things aren't very clear. There's a lot of documents kind of everywhere on Ctools, and they could probably be more well organized. Otherwise, it's essentially basic writing skills. If you are used to writing lab reports etc you'll be prepared.", "She's a really hard grader, so be very careful with proof reading. She's EXTREMELY helpful, especially one on one. Her lectures are kind of boring, but it's hard to make tech com fun. You learn a lot of very useful things for the professional world from her and from this class. It's one of the hardest (if not the hardest) section of engineering 100", "Dr. Hildinger was a great professor. Her lectures were a little boring, but you can't expect much from technical communication. Her assignments really benefitted my communication skills. Her exams are very easy if you just print out all of the notes and have them handy. Make sure to proofread! She is really picky about small mistakes.", "Very disorganized and moves very quickly through lectures. Assignments are very unclear and hard to follow. Ctools site is almost impossible to navigate and almost impossible to find anything that you are looking for. She is very helpful if you ask her a question 1 on 1 but otherwise she is confusing. Her lectures ramble on and often go off topic", "She helped me to improve my technical communication skills.", "She talks REALLY fast in lecture and can sometimes be hard to follow. Grading is very hard but helpful because she gives you suggestions. She's a very nice lady and is willing to help you. The class is a good class and you will learn a lot from it.", "She is a very nice person, but the topic she teaches is very uninteresting. Make sure you get her for discussion if you want the easier professor to grade you.", "She is very crazy, a great person but very disorganized.  She cancelled half her assignments through out the year and it wasn't a good thing.  She is a very intelligent person but I was confused and we were often tested on material we just learned in our exams and were expected to master.", "Tech comm prof for biomedical section of engr 100.  She knows that engineering students aren't that interested in tech comm and does her best to get through the material quickly.  High expectation for memos and reports, but grades fair.

Her lectures are great and she is very good at explaining things and taking any questions. I would recommend taking a class with her any day!", "She was very enthusiastic about the class and willing to talk about anything related to math in her office hours. The class itself had time consuming homework and the professor was confusing at times, but there was a great curve and the homework was graded very easily.", "Expects readings to be done beforehand. Gives psets that  can take 10+ hours. She's passionate about material, but doesn't convey it well. Took time out to really guide me individually through math (as a major). Course requires to understand, but the answers are online if you ever need them. Overall harder than 216 but worth it if interested in DEs", "Lots of theory early in the course. Assumed background in linear algebra", "Tough class, but Prof. Peterson gives clear explanations and fair exams.", "Professor Peterson is great. She has that sort of contagious enthusiasm that makes learning fun. Her lectures are never boring and she really goes the extra mile to help students succeed.", "One of the best professors at Michigan. Super helpful and accommodating. Really friendly and respectful. Provides notes prior to lecture. Records lectures. Class is a ton of work. Exams were tough. HW assignments were super long and quite challenging as were the last few labs (prelab & postlab). I still really liked the class. GSI was great too.", "Becky is one of the best professors I have had at U of M. She has amazing notes and records all her lectures. She is always willing to help if you go to OH. She genuinely wants you to learn and understand the material. Beware, this class is a lot of work but I have learned so much; I recommend that every EE takes this class.", "Peterson is a great professor, but EECS 311 is a pretty difficult class no matter who you take it with. Expect to set aside a lot of time for homework. Some weeks, it will be like 215 with Terry. Labs can be very time taking as well. Exams are pretty difficult, but the class is curved to roughly a B. All EE's should be required to take this class.", "Wasn't an easy class but she explained everything very clearly and was extremely helpful during office hours", "Very good professor. Explains things clearly in class and office hours. I'm not very passionate about semiconductors, but she made the class enjoyable.", "Great job considering it was her first semester teaching. Lecture slides are very helpful. She follows the textbook the whole way. Gives pretty good explanations, and is always happy to answer questions during office hours or over email. Very enthusiastic", "Professor He did her best to teach us, but this class is extremely difficult and is very exam heavy. She has a strong accent that is hard to understand sometimes, and she likes to whisper into the board. She's not the worst GSI but she's definitely not the best.", "Prof. Janet is very helpful. Modern Algebra is not easy, but Janet tries her best to help us during each discussion session. She is always smiling and wants us to be less nervous about knowledge. I would say that she is respectful and very caring during the whole semester.", "I found her lectures lackluster as she often had mistakes within her own slides and had to spend time correcting them. In office hours is another story - her advice and explanations were much clearer, she was extremely helpful. Also, a smoking hottie as profs go.", "One of the better 350 lecturers, but there is not much room to be a poor lecturer.  Doesn't really answer questions well in lecture, but is helpful during office hours.  Lecture is very helpful for the fill-in notes, and if you attend lecture the class is very easy.", "Nice professor, not the best lecturer, but she seems new so I think she'll get better. Very helpful during office hours", "I had her for 350 and 401. She did okay in 350, probably because she didn't write any of the lecture slides herself. But in 401, she was awful. There were always mistakes in her slides and she kept messing up. Her delivery in lecture is poor since she is always having to go back and correct herself. She's young and seems rather unexperienced.", "She wasn't bad. I couldn't get into Gunderson's lectures and found out she was one of the better Stats lecturers. She is horrible at answering questions in class but otherwise explains things clearly. Very helpful in office hours. I would recommend her if you can't get into one of Gunderson's lectures.", "Dr. Oetting is really nice and explains the material in a simple, down-to-earth fashion. She's very welcoming during office hours and tries her best to answer your questions, though at first her explanations are somewhat vague, but she got better throughout the semester. Make sure you turn your homework in time!! She's very strict about late work.", "Her lectures are clear and she posts them on time. Homework/labs designed to help you learn the material. Very helpful in office hours. This course is useful in the real world and i very much enjoyed it.", "She reads exactly what the slides say, (because she didn't write them.

Happy to answer questions but sometimes she misunderstands what you're asking or her answers are confusing.", "She is really nice and very helpful. The class in and of itself is not very difficult and it is structured to allow everyone to get the best grade possible (two calculations of grades, drop lowest homework).

To some extent, she inspired my passion for learning further about math.", "Dr Bibby was readily available for help during office hours and explained concepts clearly and cogently which helped me gain the understanding necessary to succeed in the class. I have a newfound appreciation for theoretical mathematics and am taking another math class with her next term.", "Dr. Bibby is willing to help her students a lot, and given that you'll spend the majority of your time doing homework for this class, going to her office hours is very beneficial. You can also go to any professor's office hours, so that helps. Get ready to work for this class, and the amount of time studying doesn't correlate with how well you do.", "I'm not sure why Dr. Stockbridge has such a low rating. While her lectures may be a little dry, she does try to make the information as clear as possible (despite it being difficult content). She is very receptive to feedback and makes an honest effort to improve. She truly cares about the success of her students and is amazing in office hours.", "Honestly, she made this class easier than other profs.

These reviews make her sound horrible BUT its biochem, this CLASS not Randy is just bad.", "While her lecture slide are fairly comprehensive, her presentation abilities are lacking. It seems like she's newer to lecturing, so she relies pretty heavily on the slides, which leads to an flat presentation. Using lecture recordings is a great idea- pausing and 1.5 speed are your best allies. She's a good person though, and very helpful 1 on 1.", "Dr. Stockbridge is incredibly helpful in person and on Piazza. The slides do have a lot of material on them and sometimes that can be difficult to sift through but Stockbridge does a good job of getting through all the material. It's memorization-heavy so the fact that Dr. Stockbridge is the prof doesn't change how well you can do in the class.", "OOF. Really hard to pay attention to, her voice is pretty monotonous. Rewatching lectures at 1.5 or 2x speed is really helpful for understanding her and staying focused. Tends to skip slides, and lots of slides have too much information to take in before she moves on. She seems like a really nice and supportive person but as a professor isn't great", "Would not recommend this professor. She scrambles between slides, is scatter-minded, and says the word um between every word. Unfortunately, I just could not learn from her - the worst prof I've had at UMIch so far, in my opinion.", "She sucks. I learn more by reading the lecture slides than hearing her talk. She uses \"umm\" and \"you know\" a lot and she doesn't explain anything clearly. Her exam was really detailed even though she told us to focus on the big picture in lecture. Definitely a professor to avoid.", "It was basically a self-study class. Lectures weren't helpful, and the labs seemed completely unrelated to any tests.", "this teacher changed my life. she completely reconceptualized how i think about math. the class was pretty easy since her explanations were really clear and she is very helpful in office hours. i would definitely recommend taking calc 3 with her  ", "Honestly,  Beatrice isn't any more helpful than reading the book and she takes longer than you would self studying, the only way i understood this class was by going to other lectures, Always well behind the syllabus which is not okay in a multi section class which strictly adheres to it. Definitely avoid", "Nice as a person, awful as a teacher. Gave few to no examples. Always behind schedule. Would not recommend.", "She is a relatively new professor who lacks the proper training in teaching.

Her lectures were very clear, and her office hours are extremely helpful.", "Strongly recommended teacher.Almost all the class think she is great, and truly she is.

I wasn't too interested in environmental engineering but it was kind of interesting and probably one of the easiest sections of ENGR 100. It's very easy to get by. I knew that some of the labs would be outside, but I forgot that this is Michigan and it was very cold at the beginning. Dress right", "While Aline is a very nice person, her explanation of content can turn convoluted and frankly, a mess. Some topics are fairly easy, but for more complicated topics it's probably best to go to the text. The textbook was what passed me the class. Her grading on exams was pretty harsh as well, taking major points off for minor mistakes", "Her lectures are interesting but don't exactly pertain to the project you're expected to do.  The project expectations were at times unclear but if you put in a decent effort you should be able to at least get a B+.", "Very uninteresting class. Absolute nonsense. ", "Horrible class. Horribly taught. Should never take it. Most useless class I've ever taken", "Aline is overall is a GREAT person. She really cares that students learn. She even took us on a picnic on the last day of class and bought the entire class food! ", "A River Runs Through it with Professor Cotel was a pretty fun, straightforward class.  It's one of the few 100 sections that we didn't have to turn in a physical object at the end, we just made a restoration plan.  Prof. Cotel is very passionate about the subject and is always willing to help and friendly in general.  Deadlines get pushed back.

Pay attention in lecture and the class should be real easy.", "Professor Cotel is my favorite professor in CEE so far.  You can tell she wants everyone to understand the material and be able to think about what their answers mean.  She's also really fun and is one of the most personable professors I've met at U-M.

She's also really nice with grading.", "Great professor. Her lectures are not so clear, but she makes up for it with her helpfulness. Exams are pretty easy if you understand the homeworks, and they are graded fairly.", "she was so helpful with everything!!! she was a great professor", "I felt like I didn't learn anything all semester.", "Awesome teacher. Her French accent may make her a little hard to follow, but she explains anything when asked, is very happy to meet with you outside class, and her assignments and tests are very reasonable and graded fairly easily.", "Fairly good lecturer.  Sometimes has trouble explaining things clearly.  Often is not specific enough on exam questions.  class covers allot of material and glosses over stuff near the end.", "No Comments", "To be honest, I didn't really learn the material as much from the lectures as I did from attempting the assignments and going to office hours. If you have a course with her, you should definitely go to office hours to stay on top of the course material.", "Prof. Kim is not the greatest on clarity and occasionally contradicts herself, but she is very helpful in office hours and really wants you to do well. If you attend class and go to office hours for help on the homework, you should score above average. It is very helpful to have taken multivariable calculus before this class!", "Gives out very few assignments, which is nice, but she doesn't grade any of your work until the end of the semester. That means there's no chance to know or fix your grade. She grades really specific while not offering much time out of class. In a 1 CREDIT course, she expects you to write a 2000 word essay due in the middle of finals.", "All-around great professor.  Very nice to deal with.  Gives good feedback.  Fair and accommodating.  Class structure is very clear.  Attendance does matter.  Just do the work and you'll be fine.  Amount of work required was reasonable.", "Ms. Pavlov is one of those rare instructors who seems to be on the students' side. She makes sure assignments are never tougher than they need to be, though the class inherently has too much work for the credit given. She's a cool, caring, helpful instructor and I'd take every required TC class with her if I could.", "Not my favorite. This class was WAY TOO MUCH WORK for a 1 credit class. Pavlov did not grade over half the assignments until after the semester was over. You would think you are doing very well until those assignment grades show up after the final exam period is over. Not hard to get an A range, but really takes a lot of effort to get a solid A.", "So, when I say the class was easy to pass, that has nothing to do with the content with which we covered in that class. Easily one of the most difficult classes I took here at JMU but it was because it was more of a theoretical approach to the class. I absolutely loved this class and Dr. Shehadeh. The woman is a genius. But the work was doable.", "She does not do a good job teaching. She comes to class unprepared and has convinced me that she did not go to school for math. You will have to figure things out yourself. Slow grader. Quiz every thurs. She grades very unfair on quiz day. Confuses herself so much in class that the lectures are very disorganized. I do not feel prepared to move on", "She basically just lets the online book teach you. If this is not how you learn, do not take her class", "Hala is a very nice professor who wants to see all of her students do well. Her class is tough though, and sometimes lectures were hard to follow as she goes through the material extremely fast. Two exams, homework, and attendance is your grade. Would take another professor if possible. ", "she is nice, but be sure that you have to work a lot in this class. tons of homework every week. she is not hard on grading. ", "JMU got a great professor when they got Hala she is a great teacher, she loves the students and what she does. The class has group and individual work. She is a very fair grader and gives you ample opportunities to do well in her class. Would take again if I could.", "One of my favorite professors in University and i'm not even a math major. Made this prereq course very enjoyable. ", "She is a really nice person but just an okay teacher. A lot of what you do in class is much easier than what you do for homework. The tests can be pretty tough, but it's mostly group work. She is more than willing to answer questions, though! ", "Her class is hard because the class is hard but she gives you easy points so the AB is possible for sure! Group tests so haha easy", "Go to every class, even though it's not mandatory, because then you'll def do well. She explains and is fun. She's nice and tests are easy the way she sets them up. Make sure you do your hw once a week. You'll also only use the textbook for homework. She's great! Glad she came to JMU", "I did not have to open the textbook a single time during the entire class. All I did was attend her lectures and I was able to do above-average on all of the exams, even though she wasn't the course coordinator. She is by far the clearest and most concise mathematics professor I've had, and I would recommend her for any course she teaches.", "By far my favorite teacher at michigan. I was a freshman this year and she really made the transition easy. The class is not easy but she is literally the most helpful teacher out there. It takes about two classes to get used to her accent but other than that 5 star quality. By far the best  teacher I have had at umich. Best teacher in this class!", "Very clear explanations, super friendly, and extremely knowledgeable! She's always willing to help whether it's in class, office hours, Math Lab, or email! I ended up attending her lecture rather than my assigned one because she was that much better. If there's a class you need to take and she's teaching, sign up for her section! She's excellent.", "Wow. She is a fantastic professor. She goes through a lot of examples to help us reinforce the material. I rarely used the textbook in her class. I was never even registered in her class to begin with. I had someone else and he sucked! Hala changed everthing for me and made things a whole lot easier to understand. Take her if you can!!", "In the first part of the semester I thought she was a great professor. She was very thorough with all of her explanations and she gave a lot of hints on the homework. However, towards the end of the semester she kind of gave up on us and spent the whole time rushing through examples.", "At first I thought I got stuck with the bad professor... sometimes Hala would struggle through a lecture, dragging the rest of us with her. After those first two weeks however, Hala has become a great lecturer, fantastic even, as kids from the later lectures come into ours. She's also very helpful in office hours and is a nice person overall.", "Very clear when she talks and really simplifies the material. She may be a bit slow at times but she takes care to ensure that everything makes sense.", "Good professor and explains ideas extremely well, although I feel she sometimes spends too long on one topic. This makes her get behind schedule a lot. She has a bit of an accent but its not a big deal. Homework can be hard but labs are easy marks and exams are marked fairly. Class is curved and you can skip classes whenever you want", "One of the best math professors I've had. Makes most things seem simple during lecture and explains topics thoroughly - sometimes a little too thoroughly but it's not a big issue. People from other sections started attending her lectures because their other professors weren't as good. If you have the option to take her class, do it.", "She occasionally gets behind schedule, but she is much more helpful than the book. I would recommend her for a math class."]}}; }
